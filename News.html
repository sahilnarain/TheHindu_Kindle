Of the total population of 343 in the fishermen hamlet located on the island, there are 101 male voters and 115 female voters, who have to reach their polling station at Chinna Boddu Venkatayapalem village, near Tallarevu. </p><p class="body">From their hamlet, the voters, including the aged and pregnant, have to reach Kakinada by boat. This journey takes nearly two hours. From Kakinada, all of them have to depend on private transport to reach the polling station, as public transport is not available from Kakinada shore to Chinna Boddu Venkatayapalem village. All these voters belong to Mummidivaram Legislative Assembly constituency, which is a part of the Amalapuram Parliamentary constituency. </p><p class="body">According to a resident of Hope Island, a polling station was set up on the island only once when the late N.T. Rama Rao contested the elections for the first time (in 1983). Since then, voters have been casting their vote somewhere in Tallarevu. Despite several requests, there is no response from the officials concerned to arrange for polling facility in the hamlet. Interestingly, district officials have arranged for polling stations in hamlets like Kondamodalu, Manturu and Talluru in Devipatnam mandal, where polling staff can reach only by boat. </p><hr><h1>â€˜YSRC bubble will burst after May 16â€™</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 21:36 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> The Telugu Desam Party has charged the YSR Congress with copying highlights of its manifesto, including the nine steps for accelerated development of Seemandhra region.</p><p class="body">Senior TDP leader Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said in a press release that the YSR Congress would be deserted as also the business empire of YSRC president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy once the election process was completed. The government that would come to power was sure to attach the leftover properties of Mr. Jagan, he said.</p><p class="body">He alleged that the YSRC was not formed on the basis of sound principles, but was an outcome of Mr. Jagan&#8217;s lust for power. There was no effective leadership in the party and it was full of defectors who switched over loyalties after their attempts to secure posts in the TDP and the Congress failed. &#8220;This bubble will burst after May 16, the day when the results of general elections will be announced,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="body">The senior TDP leader recalled the Supreme Court&#8217;s direction to complete investigation into the charges against Mr. Jagan and said the time limit fixed by the apex court would come to an end 58 days after the results were declared. He appealed to residents of Visakhapatnam not to vote in favour of YSRC honorary president Y.S. Vijayalakshmi warning that her victory could expand the &#8220;faction culture&#8221; to the peaceful environs of the port city.</p><hr><h1>Itâ€™s all about family fight in Jaggampeta </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 21:33 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">Family politics has been the hallmark of the Assembly constituency, with the Thotas and Jyothulas, who are also close relatives, vying with each other to wrest this segment since 1989. Jaggampeta is presently represented by former Minister Thota Narasimham, who switched loyalty to the Telugu Desam Party. But, he is contesting from the Kakinada Parliamentary constituency this time, leaving his home turf from where he won twice in 2004 and 2009. </p><p class="body">In this present election, a triangular fight between the TDP, YSRC and Congress is expected in East Godavari district. After emerging victorious in 1994 and 1999, Thotha Subbarao&#8217;s nephew Jyothula Venkata Apparao popularly known as Jyouthula Nehru lost in 2004 as a TDP candidate and in 2009 as a PRP nominee. But, after the PRP-Congress merger, he joined the YSR Congress to try his luck. </p><p class="body">Jyothula Chantibabu, who is the TDP in-charge of Jaggampeta, stood third in 2009 elections by securing 33,000 votes and Mr. Narasimham won the seat. Now, Mr. Chantibabu is getting support from Mr. Thota Narasimham&#8217;s family and his own Jyothula family. </p><p class="body">Mr. Narasimham&#8217;s relative Thota Suryanaryana Murthy alias Thota Ravi is contesting from the segment this time as a Congress candidate at the behest of Union Minister M. M. Pallam Raju. Despite him being a known face in this segment, the rising dissent among the voters against the Congress over bifurcation issue may spell trouble for him. Jaggampeta comprises Gandepalli, Gokavaram, Jaggampeta and Kirlampudi mandals. In 2004 elections, 1,26,225 votes were polled here against the total electorate of 1,56,696. Similarly in 2009, 1,47,301 voters of the total 1,86,347 exercised their franchise.</p><p class="body">Amid this political hubbub, lack of adequate irrigation facilities for the upland farmers has remained a major issue as they largely rely on rain water to cater to their agricultural needs. All the major political parties have made the modernisation of Yeleru canal the main poll agenda. YSRC candidate Jyothula Venkata Apparao had led many agitations over this issue in the past. The TDP leaders also organised several dharnas, rasta rokos demanding solutions to the farmers&#8217; woes.</p><p class="body"/><hr><h1>Chennai train blast: TN police â€˜identifyâ€™ more suspects </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 21:07 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Some more suspects in the <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/woman-killed-in-blast-at-chennai-central-station/article5965170.ece">twin bomb blasts</a> in the Kaziranga Express have been identified, Tamil Nadu Police said on Sunday claiming it has got &#8220;positive&#8221; clues on the explosions that killed a woman passenger and left 14 others injured. </p><p class="body"> Perusal of CCTV footages at the Chennai Central Station, Bangalore City Railway station and those between Bangalore and Chennai has led the CB-CID police, probing the explosion to zero in on some &#8220;positive&#8221; leads, a senior official involved in the investigation said in Chennai. </p><p class="body"> He said &#8220;some more suspects have been identified&#8221; but declined to elaborate, saying it would hamper investigations. </p><p class="body"> The official said a police team sent to Guwahati was camping there and questioning some of the passengers who travelled by the train looking for more clues that could help them track down the perpetrators of the blast. </p><p class="body"> The CB-CID police have sought the help of experts to confirm whether a suspect who boarded the Bangalore-Guwahati express at Bangalore and who was masking his face with handkerchief, was the same person who was seen hurriedly alighting at Chennai, the official said. </p><p class="body"> Police are also looking at the possibility of the blasts being the handiwork of Indian Mujahideen or some sleeper cells, he said. </p><p class="body"> A police team is continuing investigation at Bangalore. </p><p class="body"> The CB-CID has also deputed a team to Patna against the backdrop of investigations indicating that explosions there hours before Narendra Modi&#8217;s rally, was similar to that of Chennai blast. </p><hr><h1>â€˜BJP, TDP have turned politics into a game of chessâ€™</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 20:59 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">Promising to fight for protecting the State&#8217;s interests, YSR Congress (YSRC) president Y.S.

Party workers favoured any location close to Gannavaram, one of the three airports identified for upgradation with an international status in the residuary State, for building the capital city, he said.</p><p class="body">Mr. Ramesh admitted that the Congress party would pay a heavy price in the Seemandhra region for dividing the State. &#8220;I agree that our party is passing through a difficult phase and, after all, the difficulty is self-induced,&#8221; he told the media.

They had little direct effect on the Russian economy, but spurred an outflow of capital that may total $150 billion in 2014 and increased the cost of borrowing for Russian companies.</p><p class="body">According to Professor Alexei Portansky of the Higher School of Economics, Russia&#8217;s big companies will feel the pinch later this year, when they face refinancing of their foreign loans to the tune of $103 billion. </p><p class="body">Mr. Obama said that the third round of sanctions will penalise selected Russian industries, such as energy, defence and finance, including trade credits. </p><p class="body">The U.S. has already introduced restrictions on the export to Russia of high-tech dual-use products and technologies, which currently stands at about $1.5 billion a year. </p><p class="body">Experts said the ban will mainly affect Russian research institutions and some high-tech companies, but not the defence industry, which is largely self-sufficient.</p><p class="body">The Russian energy sector is unlikely to be targeted by Europe, which heavily depends on Russian supplies. Even Mr Obama admitted that it was &#8220;unrealistic&#8221; to hope that one could &#8220;turn off the tap on all Russian oil and natural gas exports.&#8221; </p><p class="body">On the day the European Union expanded sanctions against Russian officials last week, Austria&#8217;s OMG oil and gas company signed agreement with Russia&#8217;s Gazprom to extend South Stream, a natural gas pipeline Russia plans to build across the Black Sea, into Austria. </p><p class="body">The threat of sanctions has prompted Moscow to seek greater diversification of its energy exports. When President Vladimir Putin visits Beijing later this month, the two countries are expected to sign a deal on Russian gas supplies to China, which already imports over 15 million tons of Russian oil. </p><p class="body">Europe&#8217;s business is strongly opposed to sanctions. Last week Germany&#8217;s business empires, including BASF, Siemens, Volkswagen, Adidas and Deutsche Bank, issued a warning against escalating sanctions against Russia.</p><p class="body">The Kremlin hopes the sanctions will make Russia stronger.</p><p class="body">&#8220;Thanks to Western sanctions, Russia has been given incentive to reduce dependence from outside and its regional economies will instead be more self-sufficient,&#8221; Russia&#8217;s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told the Parliament a week ago. </p><p class="body">After Visa and MasterCard cut services to two Russian banks affected by U.S. sanctions, Mr. Putin approved a plan to create a national payment system within the next six months.</p><p class="body">Even Kremlin critics admit that Russia&#8217;s resilience to sanctions may be greater the West&#8217;s capacity to maintain them.</p><p class="body">&#8220;Russia has resources to withstand sanctions for at least three-five years,&#8221; said Mikhail Khodorkovsky, former oil tycoon. &#8220;Europe should first ask itself whether it is prepared to keen penalising Russia over such a long time.&#8221;</p><hr><h1>Anantha Venkatarami Reddy promises water for all under HNSS</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 19:41 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">The incumbent Anantapur MP and YSRC candidate Anantha Venkatarami Reddy said that he would initiate the supply of water from the Krishna through the HNSS project, if he is elected again.</p><p class="body">Speaking to <i>The Hindu</i>, Mr. Venkatarami Reddy said that the second phase of the Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS) project would be completed within two to three years to ensure that all parts of the district are provided water.</p><p class="body">&#8220;The endeavour shall be to fill as many tanks as possible with water from the project so as to solve drinking water and irrigation water problems to an extent.

You have to engage in political communication over a period of time. I think the Congress has been hurt by that.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> On opposition attacks against the government on corruption, he admitted that the 2G scam, the Commonwealth Games scam and other scandals certainly hurt the Congress prospects. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;I always believed that one of the foundations of politics is communication and communication from the very top... by the &#8216;sherpas&#8217; alone.

The determination is all the more important since these incidents are targeted at the minorities. I strongly condemn the acts of this group which is targeting women and children of the minority community,&#8221; said Mr. Shinde. </p><p class="body"> The MHA has already deployed 43 companies of Central Armed Forces and 10 more companies are being sent. &#8220;The Defence Ministry has also deployed 15 columns of Army comprising approximately 1,500 soldiers.

And what better way to celebrate it but with a birthday gig. </p><p class="body"> The city band, featuring Michael Dias on vocals and guitars, Kaushik Kumar on bass and vocals and Deepak Raghu on drums and vocals, plays an ethereal blend of every popular genre and simply puts in one frame &#8211; Orange Rock. Speaking to <i>MetroPlus</i> after the celebrations at Counter Culture, the band shares about life, their journey and the orange of course. </p><p class="body"> Michael says the band is his baby. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been into music since I was a kid and always wanted to have a band of my own and play my music.&#8221; The Kerala lad moved to the garden city fishing for new opportunities when he found the prize catch. &#8220;The music scene in Bangalore got me hooked. I always wanted to do a three-piece act and found bassist Kaushik, who I know from bands in Kerala, and drummer Shravan, a full-blown corporate guy, and we kicked it off. </p><p class="body"> Looking back, Michael recalls that the three of them met around February in 2011 and put together 10 songs in a couple of months. &#8220;Near the end of April was the first gig which was a real crowd-puller. We put our heart and soul into it and it paid off. Since then there has been no looking back.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Every band has its ups and downs and MOF had its share too. The three-piece act that people see now came together at the launch of our debut album with Deepak joining us,&#8221; shares Michael. </p><p class="body"> On what inspired the name and genre, Michael says right from the start he wanted it to be Mad something. &#8220;I had a little bit of a selfish motive as well since my name is Michael Antony Diaz which abbreviates as MAD. We thought of what colour our music would connect to and orange seemed to fit the profile. We play a lot of groove and there are bits of pop, lot of elements of rock, jazz influences and funk. We thought let&#8217;s call our music Orange Rock since it isn&#8217;t anywhere in particular. Fireworks seemed to round it off well.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> On turning three, Kaushik and Michael say it&#8217;s been amazing to make their dreams come true. Michael says: &#8220;The one thing I feel we will really miss is the charm of calling ourselves a new and upcoming band. We have come and are here to stay for a while now.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> MOF says their birthday celebration gig turned out to be one of their best shows. &#8220;A band turning three is no big deal but we wanted to make it special and share the platform with everyone we have met. Our set involved new material as well as old friends playing along and saw a lot of collaborations with other bands and artistes. The whole thing was a celebration.&#8221; The duo says they owe it all to their new band manager Arijeet who joined them only a few weeks back. </p><p class="body"> Their debut 10-track album Lifeline Cast was launched last year and was &#8220;quite a crazy ride&#8221;. Michael says it took them six months since they only met on Sundays but the experience was worth it. &#8220;Our songs are about simple everyday concepts. Relationships, a quarter-life crisis or a heartbreak &#8211; this is regular stuff that regular people go through and we take our own experiences and build our songs.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> On taking the leap of faith and becoming a fulltime musician, Michael says it seems to work out. &#8220;I play only with MOF and teach guitar to students. Deepak is a fulltime drummer and plays with 5-6 more bands. Only Kaushik is a freelance architect. Somehow, we have found a way to keep it going. Music is the only place where I can go to find a reason to live.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Looking ahead, MOF dreams of sharing their music with more people and going to new places. </p><hr><h1>Surrendered insurgent, aides beaten up in Imphal </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 18:03 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> One surrendered insurgent and his two accomplices were beaten up by angry residents of Mongsangei Mayai Leikai in Imphal West district on Sunday when one of them opened fire from a double barrel gun at the house of Sashikumar Akoijam. </p><p class="body"> Residents told reporters that one car had been pawned to Akoijam.

The band, comprising vocalist Natalia Rebecca, guitarist Joshua Victor, bassist Nihaal Joseph and drummer Joanna Davala, formed in January 2013 and have slowly found a space in the city&#8217;s live music circuit, moving from college competitions to club shows. Here, the band answers our questions about memorable stories, their sound and the toughest part about being a young band in the city. </p><p class="body"> <b>The story behind the band</b> </p><p class="body"> All of us had been jamming for years already and had been in other little bands before we found our beautiful sound together. </p><p class="body"> <b>You guys play music because</b> </p><p class="body"> When we&#8217;re broke, we play for money; when we crave attention, we play for the applause and when we are damn hungry, we play for food. But collectively, we want to make music that we absolutely love. That&#8217;s always the overarching incentive &#8211; great sounds. </p><p class="body"> <b>You&#8217;ll still remember the time when</b> </p><p class="body"> We&#8217;re fairly new in the circuit so all our experiences are memorable. One time we went to Vellore together and found a nice pool party and totally chilled with some great dudes. It&#8217;s Vellore, who knew, right? (Disclaimer- We love Vellore). </p><p class="body"> We probably shouldn&#8217;t confess in the newspaper but one time we had a really long wait before the show and some other bands and us used a spool of string to create a maze of &#8220;lasers&#8221; and then we played &#8220;Mission Impossible&#8221;. Maybe when we&#8217;re veterans we&#8217;ll have a smashing tale to tell of travels and dragons and novel musical conquests but for now you get &#8220;Mission Impossible&#8221;. </p><p class="body"> <b>The toughest part about being a young band</b> </p><p class="body"> Bangalore&#8217;s music scene is pretty fair because people have good taste. However, there are so many bands that there is no dearth for choice. If one band refuses to play under certain reasonable conditions, there is always another band to fill in that spot. So that makes it difficult finding work and being paid equitably for the quality and quantity of music at a show. Bad sound is another annoyance. Very few people understand the value of good sound systems, which is so frustrating sometimes. </p><p class="body"> <b>The story behind the name</b> </p><p class="body"> We changed our name at least four (official) times before settling on Pinch. We were in a hurry, we had to send in some video and we didn&#8217;t even have a name. So we came up with it in a pinch. </p><p class="body"> <b>Musicians that inspire you</b> </p><p class="body"> Radiohead, Minus the Bear, Mutemath, Submotion Orchestra, Arctic Monkeys, Two Door Cinema Club, Incubus, This Town Needs Guns, Toe, And So I Watch You From Afar, The Mars Volta, Karnivool, Protest The Hero, Hiatus Kaiyote </p><p class="body"> <b>Compositions over covers</b> </p><p class="body"> Covers aren&#8217;t really in demand anymore. Audiences are usually very appreciative of original music except when they&#8217;re drunk and want to hear &#8216;Hotel California&#8217; 400 times. Maybe they don&#8217;t relate with it immediately but it grows on them. Personally, we can&#8217;t play covers because we take more pleasure in writing than performing. We fool around in the jam room though and when we make a cover sound fresh and not identical to the original we consider playing it. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever played a cover. However, when we play in Chennai early in May, we want to do a [Chennai rock &#8216;n roll band] Skrat song because it&#8217;ll be sooper fun. </p><p class="body"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pinchbangalore" target="_blank">Follow Pinch on Facebook</a>. </p><hr><h1>I amâ€¦ Manjunath â€“ School resource person</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:57 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> I am passionate about working with children. But before I discovered my love for children, I worked in Canara Bank and took voluntary retirement in 2001. I started pursuing my hobbies which had taken a backseat earlier. So from sitting behind counters, it was off to following my passions like cricket, theatre, music, reading, trekking and other adventure activities. </p><p class="body">After a couple of years I started working with my wife in a school as a parent volunteer. That&#8217;s when my bond with children began. We did theatre, sports and other games and activities for children in schools. Then we also started working on science by using waste material and making toys as well as teaching children to do simple experiments. That was also when my sister-in-law started an organisation which had a branch called Balavihar that reached out to schools, including government, aided and unaided, that lacked certain facilities. We realised that some of them did not even have a library. So we started creating libraries, which later led to the building of our mobile library. This opened a whole new world of books for children. Then we tied up with an NGO called Asha For Education. This opened doors for us to reach out to schools with theatre and other cultural activities. We teach yoga, music, theatre and so on. </p><p class="body">During one of these sessions, a parent from a well-known Montessori school saw my work and I was invited as a resource person. There began my journey independently, sans the group. Once a week, I work with Balavihaar and the rest of the week I visit schools like Creative, Magic Puddles and Namma Shaale. Since I am a voracious reader, story telling too became a part of my repertoire. </p><p class="body">My work with children led to extensive theatre and voice exercises, exposure to the lives of people like Gandhiji, Einstein, Galileo and to know our own states like the heritage of the Cauvery river, History of India, the British Raj among others. When it comes to performing a play, I allow the children to take the lead in deciding the roles they want to perform as through the training they recognise their own strengths and weaknesses. </p><p class="body">It&#8217;s a fulfilling and a challenging job, which is like a workout&#8230; painful while you are at it, but the end result is brilliant.</p><hr><h1>A touch of Swiss</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:46 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">Stepping into the cool confines of Ottimo Cucina Italiana at ITC Grand Chola is a blessed relief from the searing Chennai heat. </p><p class="body">Through the open kitchen one can see Peter Wyss, who has been part of the luxurious Gstaad Palace in Switzerland for 41 years now.Â ChefÂ Wyss is in India as part of a four-city tour organised by Four Seasons Wines to promote the pairing of Indian wines with international food. Ironically, due to some last-minute delays in licensing, the restaurant is not permitted to serve the home-grown wine. </p><p class="body">Nevertheless, we sit down to lunch with Abhay Kewadkar, chief winemaker and director of Four Seasons Wines and Ajit Bangera, senior executiveÂ chef, ITC Grand Chola. Our meal begins with a refreshingly pink cocktail of re-carbonated white wine blended with lychee juice, pomegranate seeds and crushed ice. The cute little tartlets filled with GruyÃ¨re cheese, served as starters, are quite delicious. The salad that follows is pretty basic, greens and pine nuts, with tomato marmalade adding an interesting element. </p><p class="body">ChefÂ Wyss says, &#8220;What I liked about cooking here in India is that everything on the menu is seasonal. Back at Gstaad, we source ingredients like strawberries and mangoes from all around the world.&#8221; Hence, his Swiss version of risotto, which is thicker than its Italian counterpart, comes with a generous smattering of fresh, diced vegetables, topped with mountain cheese. It turns out to be a tad too salty and quite heavy. One can imagine savouring such a dish in a chalet on the Swiss Alps, but for Chennai&#8217;s muggy weather, it doesn&#8217;t do much.</p><p class="body">A potato rÃ¶schti topped with succulent grilled chicken and mushroom sauce follows. It&#8217;s excellent paired with a glass of red wine. Dessert, as they say, was truly the icing on the cake. A tart composed (there&#8217;s no better way to describe this creation) of melt-in-your-mouth puff pastry topped with sliced apples, caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream is the highlight of the meal.</p><p class="body">Chef Wyss says, &#8220;India could be making better wine than France in 20 to 50 years. There is a lot of competition and it takes time, but I believe it will happen.&#8221;</p><p class="body">He then passes us some freshly-made macrons and delightful Lindt chocolate: what better way to end a feast.</p><hr><h1>Bangladesh organisation told to vacate Suchitra Senâ€™s home</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:44 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> A court in Bangladesh on Sunday dismissed a plea by a pro-Jamaat-e-Islami organisation to retain possession of the ancestral Pabna home of legendary Bengali actress Suchitra Sen.</p><p class="body">A bench of Appellate Division headed by Supreme Court Justice S.K.

Disturbing photographs showing private water suppliers&#8217; &#8212; on whom these hospitals depend for water requirements &#8212; tankers refilling from dirty public drains have appeared in local newspapers. </p><p class="body"> Sources said the main water pipe meant for Imphal&#8217;s Regional Institute of Medical Sciences &#8212; which is under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare &#8212; had dried up decades ago since local residents made numerous holes in it to illegally tap water. Villagers near major rivers are not permitting private water </p><p class="body"> suppliers to use them fearing water shortage. As a result, these suppliers are delivering contaminated drain water at a high price. </p><p class="body"> Sometimes, surgeries in these hospitals had been put off due to the unavailability of contaminated raw water. Fearing infection and other deadly diseases, some patients had asked hospital authorities to allow them to buy bottled water, which was turned down by the latter. </p><p class="body"> In Manipur, all water supply schemes had been closed down some months back due to the lack of water sources. The Public Health Engineering Department had failed to translate into action the ambitious plan to distribute lake water to people. The department had submitted the action plan to the Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh. It said, inter alia, three water tankers shall be pressed into service in each of the 60 Assembly constituencies. Perhaps the Chief Minister is of the view that this will create more problems than solving the existing ones since 3 water tankers cannot supply water to the people of a constituency. </p><p class="body"> Showers in Manipur in the past few days have perhaps come as a silver lining. However, these are too sporadic to be of any relief to the people. </p><hr><h1>Hereâ€™s to some appy sporting action</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:46 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">When 29-year-old Nithin R. bowls a fast-paced delivery, the batsman, Shankar, is nonplussed. He steps out of his crease in a bid to make the ball soar high in the skies. He misses it, and the wicketkeeper stumps him before he can make a dash back to the crease.</p><p class="body">Shankar throws a fit immediately and claims that he isn&#8217;t out. But he can&#8217;t have his way &#8212; for the entire proceedings have been recorded by a teammate on his fancy iPhone. The entire team huddles around the person wielding the phone. Soon enough, Shankar is given out. Â Â Â </p><p class="body">This scene is playing out in picturesque Krishnapuri, a silent colony near Mandaveli that houses what locals like to call the &#8216;KCG&#8217; (Krishnapuri Cricket Ground). Even as technology alters the way sport is being played throughout the world, it has also made inroads into the dusty bylanes ofÂ <i>namma</i>Â Chennai, where street-sport is almost a way of life this time of the year.</p><p class="body">Gone are the days when teams were formed on the basis of &#8216;the number one gets&#8217;. Or the times when a little stone was clutched and shown to the opposition to determine who was &#8216;in&#8217; or &#8216;out&#8217; at the toss. With several mobile applications doing the same job, with perhaps much more precision and skill, an increasing number of young Chennaiites are resorting to technology to indulge in some quarrel-free games on the street. &#8220;It makes life easier,&#8221; says Nithin, a project manager at a software firm who loves outdoor sport, &#8220;When we can pay our electricity bill and shop using our mobile phones, why can&#8217;t we decide who plays who, based on a mobile phone application?&#8221;</p><p class="body">It&#8217;s not just cricket &#8212; youngsters playing other popular sports, including volleyball, badminton and basketball, also make good use of technology to determine parameters.</p><p class="body">TakeÂ MidnightÂ Badminton Marathon (MBM), for instance. Played at a bungalow at Nungambakkam&#8217;s Rutland Gate, this all-night sporting action, held during summers, uses technology quite liberally. Even before setting up court, the players log on to a mobile app to find out which way the wind is blowing, so that it doesn&#8217;t interrupt a game mid-way.</p><p class="body">That&#8217;s not all&#8230; enthusiasts waiting for their turn to play are always phone-in-hand, ever ready to log in to solve issues amicably. &#8220;When we are playing with a group of friends, fights always crop up,&#8221; explains K.P. Chidambaram, one of MBM&#8217;s organisers, &#8220;Things like what happens if the shuttle cork falls on the boundary line, or if it brushes the net and falls on the other side. When such arguments ensue, a player, who is the &#8216;make-do referee&#8217; of that particular game, immediately consults the official shuttle rules used in international matches on a mobile app or the Internet.&#8221;</p><p class="body">When that happens, arguments cease. &#8220;While we are playing just for fun and fitness, consulting an app to find out official rules about the game gives us a high. Not only does it ensure a peaceful sporting atmosphere, it also educates us a lot on-the-spot about the game we&#8217;re playing,&#8221; he adds.</p><p class="body">The advantages of using technology in street-level sport are many &#8212; apart from checking rules, there are also applications to track scores, form teams, rate players and graphically depict fixtures. And, the most exciting part is that with a little bit of technical knowledge, even you can design an app. Sriram Seshadri, a techie who designed an application that&#8217;s used among his friends, explains, &#8220;I used a simple shuffle algorithm to create an app that splits the group of players into teams of two. Basically, it aims to simplify the age-old method of making a player bend and determine who forms a team.&#8221;</p><p class="body">However, not everybody is a fan of such technology creeping into sport. Former cricketer and TV personality Bosskey says, &#8220;It is overdone these days, especially with the advent of IPL. Playing cricket on the street is all about sweating it out, literally, and staying away from electronic gadgets. What&#8217;s the fun in using a cell phone even there? Such apps only make you &#8216;immobile&#8217;!&#8221;Â </p><hr><h1>At least 11 pilgrims killed in Iraq attack</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:39 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> At least 11 Shiite pilgrims were killed and three wounded in an attack on their bus north of Baghdad, police said on Sunday.</p><p class="body">Unknown gunmen fired late Saturday on the bus carrying pilgrims, who were returning from visiting the shrine of a Shiite imam in Samarra, an unnamed security official told the independent Iraqi website <i>Almada Press</i>.</p><p class="body">The assault came days after Iraqis went to the polls to elect a new Parliament amid a surge in sectarian unrest and political disputes. </p><hr><h1>South Korean President visits kin of ferry missing</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:36 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> South Korean President Park Geun-hye on Sunday told families of those missing in a sunken ferry that her heart breaks knowing what they are going through. </p><p class="body">Ms. Park met with some 50 relatives in Paengmok port on Jindo, an island near where the ferry sank on April 16 with 476 people aboard, most of them students from a single high school.

Studio Tara, a jewellery boutique in Alwarpet, introduces its new collection as a tribute to and a respite from summer. </p><p class="body"> Cool Crystals is a collection of earrings, bracelets, necklaces and rings. &#8220;This summer we wanted to do something to counter the heat,&#8221; says Bharathi Raviprakash, the owner. &#8220;Pearls, corals and crystals bring about a sense of coolness. The closest thing to ice is natural crystal and it&#8217;s the most abundantly found natural gemstone in the world. Hence, the theme.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Also a part of the collection is a bracelet made in gold with detailed filigree work, diamonds, along with a cushion-cut Zambian emerald at the centre on a slab of crystal, enhanced with pearls on the side and twisted pearl strands for the wristband. Star-shaped earrings that have frosted crystal and diamonds are also on display. Inspired by the pyramid is a crystal pendant with white gold and diamonds embedded in it. &#8220;Each collection we introduce takes about three months to design and manufacture. These products are trendy with intrinsic design values. They can be worn anywhere, for any occasion,&#8221; says Bharathi. </p><p class="body"> There are also earrings shaped like lightening bolts, made of white gold and embedded with diamonds. Among the neck pieces is the Spatikam Navaratna Mala, set in gold with crystal beads, nine precious stones, sea gold pearls and un-cut diamonds. &#8220;Crystals are auspicious stones, especially for Hindus and so, this piece that is a contemporary take on tradition,&#8221; says Bharathi. </p><p class="body"> <i>The collection is priced Rs. 60,000 upwards and is available at Studio Tara, Kasturi Rangan Road, Alwarpet. </i> </p><hr><h1>Congress, allies differ on snoopgate probe</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:37 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> The issue of snoopgate inquiry allegedly involving BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi ran into trouble on Sunday with two UPA constituents &#8212; NCP and National Conference &#8212; opposing the move to appoint a judge in the &#8220;dying hours&#8221; of the government. </p><p class="body"> The Congress, however, declared that there was &#8220;no compromise&#8221; as the issue involved women of the country. </p><p class="body"> In a setback to the efforts to name a judge before May 16, 2014, the NCP and the National Conference questioned the move. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;When the results of the Lok Sabha elections are due in two weeks&#8217; time, where is the need for such an inquiry?&#8221; senior NCP leader and Union Minister Praful Patel told <i>PTI</i>. </p><p class="body"> Striking a similar note, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said if the decision to appoint could not be taken in December then it was wrong to appoint a judge five months later. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Was talking to my dad last night and he felt the same way &#8212; setting up a commission of inquiry in the dying hours of UPA 2 is just wrong. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;If the decision to appoint a commission was taken in Dec it should have been implemented. To appoint a judge 5 months later is wrong,&#8221; Mr. Abdullah tweeted. </p><p class="body"> Mr. Patel also said that the NCP chief Sharad Pawar has talked to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh earlier in the day to convey the party&#8217;s view in the matter. The NCP is the second largest constituent of the Congress-led UPA. </p><p class="body"> The statements came a day after Law Minister and Congress leader Kapil Sibal insisted that government planned to go ahead with naming a judge for the inquiry before May 16 before the results are out. </p><p class="body"> It was alleged that illegal surveillance was carried out on a young woman in Gujarat in 2009 at the behest of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and his then Minister of State for Home Amit Shah. </p><p class="body"> Unfazed by the opposition from its two allies, Congress spokesperson and Mahila Congress chief Shoba Oza declared there was &#8220;no compromise&#8221; on going ahead with the probe as the matter does not involve any political party, but women of the country who constitute half of the population. </p><p class="body"> Ms. Oza, however, ducked questions whether the opposition by the NCP and the National Conference meant that they were &#8220;anti-women&#8221;. </p><p class="body"> She insisted that no political party can decide on it and the Union cabinet has already taken a decision some time back and it was also announced. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;The issue is not a personal business of anyone. How does it matter (that a judge was not appointed so far)? There will be a commission and there will be a judge. Why there should be pressure?&#8221; she said. </p><p class="body"> Ms. Oza also attacked the BJP alleging that leaders like Arun Jaitely were &#8220;trying to threaten&#8221; judges against taking up the enquiry. The idea was floated by them that Congress was not getting judges. </p><p class="body"> She also alleged that in order to silence the family of the young architect girl, it was awarded contracts without floating tenders. </p><p class="body"> The party also came out with 10 questions to the BJP including Mr. Modi, Mr. Shah and Mr. Jaitley on snoopgate controversy, asking them to &#8220;come clean&#8221; on the illegal surveillance of a young woman allegedly at the instance of the Gujarat Chief Minister. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Why did Modi as also Pranlal Soni, father of the girl, not disclose the fact that Modi knew the young architect girl for close to five years, since 2005 prior to mounting of surveillance on the woman, her friends and acquaintances. </p><p class="body"> Observing that Right to Privacy is part of fundamental rights of &#8216;Right to Life&#8217; under Article 21 of the Constitution, the Congress asked whether Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah have the right to conduct surveillance on a young girl as also tap her phones, phones of her friends and acquaintances with complete impunity in a totally illegal fashion. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Why were extensive spying operations launched on an &#8216;oral undated request&#8217; by father of an adult girl, as is being alleged in hindsight as a mode of defence?&#8221; </p><p class="body"> The Congress also termed as &#8220;shocking&#8221; the entire BJP leadership&#8217;s continuous and steadfast refusal to answer the reason, purpose and motive behind spying on a young woman at the instance of Mr. Modi. </p><hr><h1>UPA welfare laws will go if BJP comes to power, says Rahul</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:33 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Questioning BJP&#8217;s intention on development issue, Congress vice-president <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-just-replaced-hand-with-lotus-rahul-gandhi/article5922624.ece" target="_parent">Rahul Gandhi</a> on Sunday alleged that the saffron party if voted to power planned to abolish welfare laws such as food security and employment guarantee introduced by the UPA government. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;I have got information that the intention of BJP and Mr. Modi is not clean. They intend to abolish legislations like food security, employment guarantee etc,&#8221; he alleged while addressing an election rally at Tekarmafi in Amethi. </p><p class="body"> <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rahul-gandhi-criticises-bjps-divisive-politics/article5872393.ece" target="_parent">Mr. Gandhi</a> alleged that farmers, who had been deprived of their land in Gujarat, were not being considered as native residents and were being forced to leave the state. </p><p class="body"> Alleging that Mr. Modi&#8217;s development model was limited to one or two industrialists of which one was Mr. Adani, Mr. Gandhi claimed that Congress waived off Rs 70,000 crore loan of the farmers while on the other hand Mr. Modi gave land worth Rs. 40,000 crore to Mr. Adani alone. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;In Gujarat, 45,000 acre land of farmers was given to Mr. Adani at the rate of Re. 1 per square metre, which was later sold at the rate of Rs. 800 per square metre. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Before giving land to Mr. Adani, Mr. Modi didn&#8217;t even ask farmers even once. I fought for Bhatta Parsaul, therefore we formulated the land acquisition law,&#8221; he said. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Farmers in Gujarat are a harassed lot. They are being forced to leave the state saying that they were not native residents. Some of the farmers met me and narrated their stories,&#8221; Mr. Gandhi added. </p><p class="body"> The <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rahul-gandhi-challenges-modis-forte-projects-his-own/article5793184.ece" target="_parent">Congress vice-president</a> said he respected women a lot and realised that they played an important role in the working of the country and had, therefore, created opportunities for 12 lakh of them by connecting them with banks. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Mr. Modi talks about giving power to women. I want to tell him that women of India are not weak. They are internally strong. Mr. Modi should learn to respect women,&#8221; he said and raked up the &#8216;snoopgate&#8217; row by alleging that policemen in Gujarat used to tap phones of women and harassed them. </p><p class="body"> Continuing his tirade against Mr. Modi, Mr. Gandhi said the BJP prime ministerial candidate has claimed that Rs 8,000 crore was allocation on education and health under his Gujarat model but despite this, facilities there were very poor. </p><p class="body"> Mr. Gandhi said while Congress stands for the politics of unity, others were dividing people on religious lines. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;We want a country where no one is hungry, every person has a roof of his own. A place where free treatment facility is available and there is a smile on the face of a poor person. In this Lok Sabha election if Congress government comes to power, we will do all this,&#8221; he said. </p><p class="body"> Claiming emotional connect with Amethi, Mr. Gandhi said, &#8220;I came to Amethi with my father Rajiv Gandhiji at the age of 12. At that time there were no roads, power, drinking water, industries and school. I have not come here with political intention, I have a homely relation. Our relationship is that of heart, which opposition parties could not digest.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Rajivji framed farsighted development schemes as a result Amethi has changed today. Those, who are opposing me, Soniaji and Priyankaji, are those, who used to oppose Rajivji as well. Some people have come here with the intention to separate us,&#8221; Mr. Gandhi alleged. </p><hr><h1>Art for all</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:31 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">My hand is trying to arrest the wobble,&#8221; says 12-year-old Surabhi. She is shaping a small clay pot on a potter&#8217;s wheel at Rainbow Fish Studio in Kotturpuram. She, along with Suchit, Adia, and friends, are learning pottery from Potrarasan, as part of a summer course at the newly-launched visual art school. The art studio is filled with clay masterpieces the children made &#8212; they have sculpted crocodiles, fish, penguins&#8230;Another batch of students is learning graphic designing &#8212; they are making posters to promote Paris. </p><p class="body">Rainbow Fish Studio is an art school with a difference &#8212; they have art and design courses tailored specifically to develop an eye for art in children. Be it a session on &#8216;Shapes, Figures, &amp; Strange Machines&#8217;, &#8216;Jungle art&#8217;, or &#8216;Maps and Info Design&#8217;, their courses aim to urge a child to appreciate art that surrounds him/her. </p><p class="body">Sara Vetteth, who started the school, wishes that children open their eyes &#8220;to the incredible beauty around them.&#8221; For instance, in India, almost every street corner has a temple &#8212; but do children really stop to admire them? Art should go beyond being just a hobby, feels Sara. </p><p class="body">At Rainbow Fish, children learn about portraits, self- portraits; hear of Van Gogh, Picasso, and Munch; explore folk art styles; understand the components that make up building architecture&#8230;the courses are tailored for kids aged from five to seven, seven to 10, and 10 to 14. </p><p class="body">Sara, who holds a Masters degree from Parsons School of Design in New York, says that Rainbow Fish will not stop with their summer programmes. She hopes to develop &#8220;after school design courses&#8221; that children can enrol for. She is backed by a qualified team of instructors to help her do so. Actor and photographer Sunder, for instance, will teach the kids photography, architect Kalpana Balaji who runs her own design firm with her husband in the city, will hold sessions on the principles of architecture. In the long run, Rainbow Fish will become a place where &#8220;schools outsource their weekly art classes,&#8221; says Sara. She feels that even one art class per week during the course of the year will make children &#8220;enjoy and appreciate the world around them much more.&#8221; </p><hr><h1>RTI activist appointed as consultant to Delhi government </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:29 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">Lt.

From walking to jogging, most people find their own pace to move around the park, while some others play a game of badminton and a few more take part in a group yoga session. The children keep themselves occupied on the swings and the monkey bars or walk along side their parents, looking at the morning sunlight dripping in through the canopy of trees. As the summer sun signals everyone that it is time to wrap up their morning workout session, Palanichamy and his wife, Lalithabai, who are practitioners of Siddha, walk in with a home-brewed Siddha drink to kick start everyone&#8217;s morning. A concoction made of many Indian herbs such as beetle leaves, neem, <i>omam</i> and pepper, the drink proves to be a socialising agent for all the fitness enthusiasts around. </p><p class="body"> People from all walks of life gather around to chat over their morning health drink which has become an indispensible part of their workout sessions. Retirees, advocates, bank managers, railway officers and people from different professional disciplines sip their drink and voice their concerns about the social and political issues of the day. Over a cup of health drink, the early risers of Anna Nagar have found a place to meet and make friends, often discussing problems from work and life, to clear their mind before they start their day. &#8220;We have too many personal and social responsibilities during the day, so we only get to do this in the mornings&#8221;, says Nallaperumal and complains that without the drink he feels sluggish throughout the day. </p><p class="body"> The brewers of this famous concoction, Dr. Palanichamy and Dr. Lalithabai, are retired Siddha doctors who fell in love while they were qualifying themselves in Indian medicine. After travelling through South India, educating people about various Indian herbs and medicines, the couple moved to Chennai to enjoy their retirement. For 11 years they frequented the park before they came upon the idea of providing their home-brewed drink to their old friends and now, many new ones. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about sharing what you know,&#8221; says Dr. Palanichamy, who smiles generously at everyone and holds the same views about happiness. &#8220;When we&#8217;re happy in life, it is important to spread the happiness to those we come across.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Married for the last 40 years, the retired doctor couple still seem very much in love with each other and with life. Dr. Lalithabai&#8217;s love for variety makes sure that the morning drink she makes has different ingredients and flavour every day. To mark the beginning of the summer vacation, a health drink that tasted deceptively similar to lemon juice was made for the children who&#8217;ve begun to visit the park in the mornings. This just goes to show that whatever your age, your profession or preferred morning exercise routine, the morning socials in Gandhi Park will be more than happy to have you join them. </p><hr><h1>Madras labour and May Day</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:17 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">A rather confused reader, L.A. Rajendra sent me a letter shortly before May Day wondering who really had started the first trade union in Madras. He&#8217;d heard of at least four claimants to that honour and was thoroughly confused by not only these claims but also by the different stories circulating about those beginnings.</p><p class="body">In fact, I&#8217;ve heard six names mentioned, Annie Besant and Ramanujalu Naidu were the additions to Rajendra&#8217;s four: M. Singaravelar Chetty, B.P. Wadia, G. Selvapathy Chetty and Thiru Vi Kalyanasundaram Mudaliar. But as far as I can gather, the story goes like this.</p><p class="body"> Selvapathy Chetty, a small businessman, took over a <i>sabha </i>his father was running and moved it to D&#8217;Mellow&#8217;s Road, Perambur, alongside the Buckingham &amp; Carnatic Mills campus, where it was converted into a club of sorts. Moving on from religious discourses and bhajan singing that the <i>sabha </i>had originally offered, it began offering lectures by eminent personalities on a variety of current topics. Then, during the Great War, there were daily discussions on the progress of the war and what it all meant to India. A large number in the audience were mill workers and, before and after meetings, they would pour out tales of woe about the happenings in the mills to Selvapathy Chetty and his friend and fellow trader Ramanujalu Naidu. The two helped many of the workers to write petitions to the management, but, gradually, as they got more involved with the problems of the workers, they began to feel that something formal needed to be organised to negotiate with the mills&#8217; management for the amelioration of the harsh working conditions.</p><p class="body"> On March 2, 1918, the two organised a public meeting near the mills where several speakers addressed a 10,000-strong audience, mainly of mill workers. Philosophical and religious themes, as advertised, were the subjects of all the speakers bar one, whose topic had only been whispered about. Thiru Vi Kalyanasundaram (ThiruViKa) forcefully urged them to form a trade union; that would be the only way they would get fair treatment, he had argued.</p><p class="body"> Selvapathy and Ramanujalu next went to meet Annie Besant of <i>New India </i>and invited her to address a meeting where the union would be inaugurated. She was unavailable but B.P. Wadia, her colleague, was. With Wadia presiding, a mammoth meeting was held on April 27, 1918 in Perambur at which the formation of the Madras Labour Union (MLU) was announced. Wadia was its first President, Selvapathy and Ramanujalu its first General Secretaries and ThiruViKa, Sella Guruswamy Chettiar and Dewan Bahadur Kesavapillai it first Vice Presidents. The Union survives to this day.</p><p class="body"> It has been claimed that this was the first trade union in India. This claim is perhaps in the context that it is still in existence, its name unchanged, and was formed as an organisation in rather formal circumstances. A year earlier, a union had been formed by mill workers in Ahmadabad, but from reports I&#8217;ve heard, it did not survive for long nor did it have a formal structure.</p><p class="body"> As far as the MLU is concerned, if I had to pick a founder, I would choose Selvapathy and Ramanujalu as its joint founders, though from what I&#8217;ve heard the latter would have most likely given the honour to the former.</p><p class="body"> Singaravelar was undoubtedly a fellow-traveller with this group when it came to trade unionism, but he was more a political figure. He was associated with the Congress Party, but broke with it over differences with Gandhiji, and, on May 1, 1923, at what was then the High Court Beach and Triplicane Beach, he announced the formation of his Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan and wanted May 1st declared a holiday. And, so, May Day, International Workers&#8217; Day, came to India thanks to Singaravelar. He next helped form the Communist Party of India (CPI) over whose founding he presided in 1925. Then he broke with the Communists and became associated with the Self-Respect Movement and its overtones of Dravidian politics.</p><p class="body">But thereafter, with age catching up, he gradually faded from the political scene, though maintaining an interest in all the causes he had espoused. </p><p class="body"> *****</p><p class="body"><b>An architect&#8217;s story </b></p><p class="body"> My quest for information about J.R. Davis of Prynne, Abbott and Davis (Miscellany, April 21) brought me much information from P.T. Krishnan, who had a latter day connection with a successor firm, and a rather rude phone call from a reader who refused to send me his information in writing, which is the only way I like it as I am averse to long telephone calls that necessitate taking notes I&#8217;m hard put to later decipher.</p><p class="body"> From what Krishnan and I have been able to piece together, it would seem Prynne, Abbott and Davis (PAD) had its beginnings in one of the first firm of architects in Madras, Jackson and Barker, who set up practice around 1922. They were responsible for converting the Spencer&#8217;s-owned Connemara Hotel&#8217;s building, that at the time resembled something better suited to a forest lodge, into a then modern hotel building that reflected a classical art deco style. The remodelled Connemara opened in 1937 to rave reviews. Today&#8217;s faÃ§ade and much of the main block are what Jackson and Barker bequeathed to the Connemara.</p><p class="body"> Shortly before World War II, H.F. Prynne took over Jackson and Barker when the partners were planning to return to the U.K. Prynne, curiously, was no architect; he was the Governor&#8217;s ADC. And his first architectural work, so to speak, was to convert the stables of his house on College Road into his firm&#8217;s offices. He was joined by Abbott and Davis. It is stated that Abbott never took his place with the firm, passing away during his journey to India. When Prynne went back to England in the early 1950s, Davis stayed on and ran the firm till the 1960s, when Kiffin-Petersen and Bennett Pithavadian (whose father changed his name from Fenn to Pithavadian), who had worked for the firm, took it over. Amongst the best buildings PAD designed were the University of Madras&#8217;s Library and Teaching (Clock Tower) Block and the <i>Centenary Building</i>, both raised in harmony with <i>Senate House</i>. If Abbott never made it to Madras, the bespectacled person explaining the <i>Centenary Building</i>&#8217;s model to Prime Minister Nehru in my 1957 picture today must have been Davis, though the University has named him as Abbott in a caption it has used. Davis was also responsible for the <i>Bombay Mutual Building </i>and <i>Dare House </i>on N.S.C. Bose Road.</p><p class="body"> Another noteworthy building the firm did design was <i>Adyar Villa </i>in Kotturpuram, the assignment for his home being given to it by M.A. Chidambaram, who was a good friend of Davis. The design, however, was by Kiffin-Petersen, an Australian, who favoured the Spanish villa style that Florida&#8217;s Palm Beach had made famous in the 1930s. Many of the corporate houses in the Boat Club area too were designed by him. Davis returned to England in the early 1960s before construction of <i>Adyar Villa</i> started and the building was raised during the Petersen-Pithavadian partnership that succeeded Davis.</p><p class="body"> When Kiffin-Petersen left Madras in the late 1960s, Prynne, Abbott and Davis was taken over by Pithavadian who ran it as a proprietorship. Then, in 1972, he took in partners and renamed the firm Pithavadian &amp; Partners. Of Pithavadian Krishnan, who had worked with him, says, &#8220;A McGill University, Canada, graduate, he was a modernist more concerned with the problems of a poor country and used his civil engineering skills to produce functional and economical buildings. He won the President&#8217;s Gold Medal for the design of a low-cost house during the early years of his practice.&#8221; Later, however, he was responsible for another type of landmark in Madras, the <i>IOB Building</i>, &#8220;the first highrise in Madras responding to principles of designing for the tropics.&#8221;</p><p class="body"> I&#8217;d be glad to hear from my caller who prefers telephone-chat to writing if he has anything more to add to this &#8212; provided he sends it in duly written. </p><p class="body">*****</p><p class="body"><b>When the postman knocked&#8230;</b></p><p class="body">- A copy of Ravenshaw&#8217;s 1822 map of Madras is with P.T. Krishnan and, he tells me, the five boundary pillars of the second esplanade, the one beyond the New Town Wall (Miscellany, April 14), are marked on it. Only, the present site of the Washermenpet Police Station is nowhere near where the boundary marker is shown on that map. The plaque had obviously been moved, as I had conjectured. Krishnan also tells me that the boundary markers also indicate on the map the boundaries of Royapuram, Tondiavoodu (Tondiarpet) and Washermenpet. Three paths led out of gates in the Wall and crossed the esplanade. These paths became, from west to east, Tiruvottriyur High Road, Monegar Choultry Road, and Mannarsamy Koil Street. Their gates, I reckon, would have respectively been what were called Ennore Gate, Trivatore Gate and Pully Gate. I look forward to more details of this area from Krishnan. </p><p class="body">- Dr. R.V. Rajan (Miscellany, April 21), writes Dr. P.S. Venkateswaran, had studied to become a surgeon and went to England where he got his FRCS, but got interested in Venereology and became an internationally recognised expert on the subject. Dr. K.S. Sanjivi, who was part of Dr. RVR&#8217;s intellectual circle, retired as Professor of Medicine and was awarded the Padma Bhushan. But in what must be a unique record, Dr. Sanjivi&#8217;s brothers, Prof. K. Swaminathan and Dr. K. Venkat Raman, were also awarded the same honour. Swaminathan, Professor of English at Presidency College, turned to journalism after he retired and then became the Chief Editor of the 90-volume <i>Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi</i>. Dr. Venkat Raman retired as the Director of the National Chemical Laboratory. As for Dr. RVR, as already mentioned, he went on to become the first Indian Dean of the Madras Medical College, but, points out Dr. Venkateswaran, it was a designation that came into being after the term &#8216;Superintendent&#8217; had been done away with. Two Indians had served as Superintendents, Col. Pandalai and Dr. Sangam Lal. Dr. Rajam lived on G.N. Chetty Road in a house that has now given way to <i>Ankur Plaza</i>. As was the vogue those days, it was &#8220;a sort of semi-circular house (art deco?) with many doors. Dr. Rangachary&#8217;s house had 16 doors; Dr. Rajam had fewer.&#8221; </p><hr><h1>Of music and a Million Dollar Arm</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:10 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> When you see a shot of two kids running into an open field in the Hollywood flick <i>Million Dollar Arm</i> (MDA), which is releasing this Friday in India, check out the music that goes along with it. You&#8217;ll hear a Tamil song &#8212; yes, you read that right &#8212; playing in the background. That number, &#8216;Thirakkadha kaatu kulle&#8217;, sung by Unnikrishnan and Chitra, featured in the 1999 film <i>En Swasa Kaatre</i>, and will be heard again, this time by global audiences. </p><p class="body"> It&#8217;s evident that music composer A.R. Rahman is at work again. So, how did this song fit into a Hollywood flick? &#8220;Frankly, I really didn&#8217;t know how it landed there,&#8221; he laughs, &#8220;The makers were researching my Indian music and must&#8217;ve stumbled upon this. When I saw the movie, I was like, &#8216;Wow, where did that come from.&#8217; But it felt so good. I didn&#8217;t feel any need to change it.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Interestingly, the lyric go with the situation in the film. &#8220;It&#8217;s strange because when they picked up this song, they had no clue what it meant. But the situation was about kids who have achieved something major. And when the lyric &#8211; <i>Thirakaadha</i> <i>Kaatukulle Pirakaadha Pillaigalpole </i>&#8212; plays along with it, it just sounds so fantastic,&#8221; says Rahman. </p><p class="body"> <i>Million Dollar Arm</i> came to the Mozart of Madras through Disney and he accepted to do the score due to the subject and his state of mind at that time. &#8220;I was in a good mindscape when this project came,&#8221; he recalls, &#8220;For three years, I was avoiding Indian-based subjects in Hollywood as I was anyway doing them in Hindi. The last thing I wanted was to be typecast as a composer who&#8217;d only work on English films with an Indian setting. But when this script came along, I thought it was a good time to start again. It helped that the story was also hybrid in nature.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> The themes of both <i>Slumdog Millionaire</i> and <i>Million Dollar Arm </i>have similarities, for they focus on the underdog. Does he consciously pick such subjects? &#8220;Oh no, not at all,&#8221; he quickly clarifies, &#8220;It&#8217;s just a coincidence, that&#8217;s all.&#8221; His Hollywood film is slated for an Indian release this Friday, at a time when fans across the world will be celebrating Superstar Rajinikanth&#8217;s <i>Kochadaiiyaan</i>, which has music by Rahman too. How different was it working on these two films? &#8220;<i>MDA</i> is more contemporary. In terms of music, it is more orchestral. Rajini&#8217;s film, on the other hand, is a period film and working on that was very different. Both the movies, of course, have got their own set of audiences.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Rahman also seems to have taken his role as a singer very seriously, having crooned in most of his recent albums. Ask him if he&#8217;s becoming choosy these days as a singer, &#8220;Not at all&#8230;it&#8217;s just that I want to spend a lot of time with the song before I can deliver it. I need to do <i>riyaz</i> regularly in order to sing well. I need at least three hours a day for that but I&#8217;m not able to get that kind of time now, with all the travelling and composing assignments and as the head of my music school. That&#8217;s why even when other composers call me for singing; I don&#8217;t usually take it up. To sing the way I want to, I need to work hard and practise. I feel that my voice is God&#8217;s gift and a lot of people seem to like it. Actually even I like it,&#8221; he chuckles. </p><p class="body"> With a host of projects, both nationally and internationally, he&#8217;s a busy man. Is time-management a big issue? &#8220;Well, travelling does take a toll on my health. I think I have to reduce the number of films I commit to &#8212; I might be doing too much now.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> After delivering a global hit song like &#8216;Jai Ho&#8217;, do Hollywood composers come up to him with requests for another &#8216;viral hit&#8217;? &#8220;Actually, the pressure to deliver a hit song is much more in India,&#8221; he says, &#8220;In Hollywood they tend to concentrate more on the score. If they want a hit song, they&#8217;ll somehow manage to get it from you.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Back in Tamil, Rahman has Shankar&#8217;s <i>Ai</i> and Vasanthabalan&#8217;s <i>Kaaviyathalaivan. </i> &#8220;<i>Kaavithalaivan</i>I completed the last song of <i>Kaaviyathalaivan</i> just a few days back,&#8221; he reveals, &#8220;I thoroughly enjoyed working on it as it has elements of classical and folk music.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> And there&#8217;s more good news for fans of the Rahman-Rajini combination, for they&#8217;re coming back again for the Superstar&#8217;s next film, titled <i>Lingaa</i>. &#8220;It&#8217;s too early to talk about it,&#8221; he smiles, &#8220;But yes, a Rajini film is always special.&#8221; </p><hr><h1>Making a mark in the outdoors </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:05 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> <b>Wild encounters</b> </p><p class="body"> Five owlets perched on a tree &#8212; this stunning photograph made it to the final round of judging at the photography competition (11 to 14 years category) conducted by BBC and London Natural History Museum, beating lakhs of entries.

R. Prakash remembers how the little girl rushed to the farm near Perur in her school uniform to catch a glimpse of the owlets. &#8220;I waited for three hours. Two owlets were already there and, after a while, the other three peeped out,&#8221; Sitara says. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;More than clicking the photographs, I enjoy watching the behaviour of animals,&#8221; she says. Sitara accompanies her father and R. Prakash to Kabini, Masinagudi, Mudumalai, Attakatti, Aliyar and Valparai and shoots using a Canon 1 D Mark IV camera and 100 mm and 400 mm lenses. </p><p class="body"> One of her favourite photographs from the collection is that of a leopard with its kill on top of a tree, which she clicked in Kabini. &#8220;I also observe. For example, while clicking the great hornbill in Valparai, I learnt about their fascinating nesting behaviour.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> <b>Meet the champ</b> </p><p class="body"> As a seven-year-old, S. Boopathy would always hang around the neighbourhood tennis court near the Railways Colony in Erode. He would sneak his way through the fence, pick the ball, and throw it back to the players. Now, he has won laurels in the under-10 and under-12 categories and is now ranked fourth in the All India Tennis Association (AITA) ranking in the under-12 category. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t expect him to go the tournament level. But, he improved with every game,&#8221; says M. Sakthivel, his father, a Railways employee. &#8220;Everyone is competitive, so I really work hard, and practice regularly,&#8221; says Boopathy, a class VII student at Vidya Niketan, Coimbatore. His first win came in the under-10 category, in a State Ranking tournament conducted by the Triangle Tennis Trust. His major breakthrough was when he won the National-level Championship series conducted by AITA in Anantapur in the under-12 category. Boopathy&#8217;s recent win was at the National series conducted by AITA in Bangalore where he won the singles and doubles. </p><p class="body"> Though attending tournaments is a costly affair for this middle-class family, Boopathy takes part in at least 10 a year. With help from sponsors, he can do even better. Boopathy&#8217;s mother K. Selvi says it is important for every parent to identify and encourage a child&#8217;s interest. &#8220;For example, tennis calls for stamina, will power and confidence. These qualities will help him in any field.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> <b>In the company of birds</b> </p><p class="body"> For Bharath, a four-time winner of SACON&#8217;s &#8216;Young Birdwatcher of the Year&#8217; award, the inspiration came from his parents. R. Parvathi and B. Ravikumar, both wildlife enthusiasts, initiated Bharath, now has just given his Class 12 exams, into the hobby when he was five years old. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Along with studies, we wanted him to have a healthy distraction. All three of us together learnt the joys of bird watching. A healthy hobby paves the way for better thinking,&#8221; says Parvathi. </p><p class="body"> Bharath says bird watching teaches him patience and also helps him to be attentive. &#8220;You can soak in the silence, and the peaceful outing refreshes you. Seeing me, a number of my batchmates got interested in the hobby and now go on treks to watch birds and wildlife,&#8221; he adds. </p><p class="body"> He recalls a memorable trek in Bhutan where he spotted rare birds such as blood pheasants, Rufus necked hornbill, Rufus bellied eagle and brown fish eagle. &#8220;I take a note of the species and write a description on appearance and colour, cross-check with the field guide and then identify the bird. This helped me identify the birds at the SACON competition; I identified about 75 species.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> A regular at the bird watching trips of Coimbatore Nature Society, he has visited the wetlands and tanks in and around Coimbatore, Tirupur, Sholiayur, Anaikatty, and also the Corbett National Park. &#8220;Once you take in the beauty of Nature, you become responsible about your environment. You just have to look around in your neighbourhood to identify egrets, coots, black kites and shikras&#8230;.&#8221; </p><hr><h1>Astra successfully test-fired from Sukhoi-30 MKIÂ </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 17:21 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Astra, India's first indigenously developed Beyond Visual Range (BVR) air-to-air missile was successfully test-fired from a Sukhoi-30 MKI at a naval range in the Western Sector, marking a major step in missile-aircraft integration. </p><p class="body"> The test-firing met all the mission objectives and the air-launch was captured by side and forward looking high-speed cameras and the separation was exactly as per simulation, according to a press release from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). </p><p class="body"> Congratulating the team, Avinash Chander, Sceintific Advisor to the Defence Minister and DG, DRDO, observed that the launch was a major step in missile aircraft integration. He said this would be followed by a launch against an actual target shortly. "Many more trials are planned and will be conducted to clear the launch envelope. Weapon integration with 'Tejas', Light Combat Aircraft will also be done in the near future", he added. </p><p class="body"> V.G. Sekaran, Director General (Missiles and Strategic Systems), who chaired the Flight Readiness Review Committee, described it as one of the proud moments for DRDO and the entire country. Dr. K. Tamilmani, Director General (Aeronautics), who oversaw the entire flight safety in the program, said the quality of integration and performance was high. This was the beginning of the phase for demonstration of launch over a wide air-launch envelope. </p><p class="body"> Director, DRDL, S.Som, said "it is a first of its kind and a good achievement". Astra's project director, S. Venugopal, said the air launch was perfect in all respects. It was the culmination of effort by a dedicated team from the Missile Complex, Hyderabad, CEMILAC (Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification) and the IAF. HAL carried out modifications in Su-30 along with IAF specialists, while many Indian industries played an important role in the production of reliable avionics, propulsion system, materials, air-frame and software passing stringent airworthiness requirements for the missile. </p><p class="body"> In 2013, the missile underwent rigorous testing on an Su-30 in captive mode for avionics integration and seeker evaluation. </p><p class="body"> He said the project reached the final stage of testing and evaluation and Astra MK-II variant with higher capability is planned to be tested by the end of 2014. </p><p class="body"> Designed and developed by DRDO, Astra possesses high Single Shot Kill Probability (SSKP), making it highly reliable, the release said. Describing Astra as a highly advanced state-of-the-art missile, the release said it is an all-weather missile with active radar terminal guidance, excellent ECCM (Electronic counter-countermeasures) features, smokeless propulsion and process improved effectiveness in multi-target scenario. </p><hr><h1>All smooth and silky</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 16:56 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Suma sits on the consultation chair and reels off what she thinks are issues with her hair. &#8220;It&#8217;s too dry, too brittle and I have severe hairfall,&#8221; she says. </p><p class="body"> Kavya Rajan, education trainer, P and G Salon Professional (SP), listens intently and then begins her examination. She weaves her fingers through the client&#8217;s hair, and checks it for tension and texture. Suma is for a surprise. Her hair is not dry; it&#8217;s just damaged at the ends. She has normal hair fall, but also has dandruff. &#8220;Losing up to 100 hair strands a day is very normal,&#8221; Kavya assures her. </p><p class="body"> Chennai-based Kavya was at Green Trends salon, Race Course, recently for a day-long training and demo session of Wella SP&#8217;s Alchemy hair treatments. She mixed and matched creams and infusions to treat Suma&#8217;s dandruff and hair damage and gave her a relaxing 20-minute massage before rinsing it off. After a blow-dry, Suma&#8217;s hair has a new shine. </p><p class="body"> Those without dandruff will be given a five-minute steam session too. The Alchemy range of services for men and women is said to treat a range of hair issues with an equally wide variety of customised products. </p><p class="body"> Kavya sees a lot of damaged hair in her profession. The damage could be due to constant ironing, colouring or usage of harsh chemicals. &#8220;People don&#8217;t think twice before ironing their hair every day, without taking any precautions such as using a hair-protection cream,&#8221; she says. &#8220;You will not iron the same shirt every single day, right?

The EC has failed (in checking the rigging),&#8221; Mr. Modi said in Badohi. </p><p class="body"> Daring the EC to lodge another FIR against him if it thought his words violated its Model Code, Mr. Modi said he had nothing to lose and could happily go back to selling tea. &#8220;Duniya ko darana, Modi ko darane ki koshish matt karo. (You can scare the world. Don&#8217;t you dare try to scare Modi.) But I will not allow the violation of democracy,&#8221; he said in a frontal attack on the EC. Mr. Modi had earlier been pulled up by the EC for taking a selfie with the BJP's election symbol, a lotus, and then addressing the media after casting his vote at the polling booth in Ahmedabad on April 30. </p><p class="body"> Mr. Modi alleged that booths were captured at various places but the EC was silent on it. In a dual attack on the Samajwadi Party government for fostering unruly elements and the EC for failing to check these elements, Mr. Modi said &#8220;any stain on democracy will rub on the face of the EC," which is responsible for ensuring free and fair elections. </p><p class="body"> To protect citizens from this 'goondagardi' (hooliganism) during elections, security forces should be mobilized and supplemented with paramilitary forces, he later said at an election rally in Allahabad, where he was campaigning for the BJP candidates for the Allahabad and Phulpur seats. Mr. Modi also promised that if voted to power he would work to clean Parliament of criminal elements. &#8220;I will submit the affidavits of the MPs (declaring their criminal records) to the Supreme Court and request it to ensure that all these cases are solved within a year. Those (MPs) who are found guilty will be sent to jail. They will have to vacate their seats and re-election will be conducted.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Mr. Modi also trained his guns at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, mocking him for his comments on poverty and visits to Dalit dwellings. Accusing Mr. Gandhi of treating poverty as an object of tourism, Mr. Modi said he visits the poor once a year just like people celebrate (gazatted) holidays or visit a tourist sight.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> While in Badohi, Mr. Modi promised to rejuvenate its moribund carpet industry, in Allahabad, he said under his rule the historical Allahabad University would attain global repute while the industrial area along the Yamuna would get a new lease of life. Allahabad, Phulpulr and Badohi go to the polls on May 7. </p><hr><h1>Leaps and bounds</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 16:50 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> The infectious smile endears you to one of India&#8217;s most accomplished athletes; and unsung too. For Anju Bobby George, athletics has been one great journey, beginning with her love for heptathlon before the transition to long jump at the behest of coach T.P. Ouseph. &#8220;The turning point of my career,&#8221; she reflects on the decision to pursue long jump. </p><p class="body"> Anju made history when she claimed the long jump bronze medal with a 6.70m leap at the 2003 World Championships in Paris, becoming the first Indian athlete to win a World Championships medal. Success sits lightly on her shoulders for humility sets her apart. Honoured with the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award in 2003 and Padma Shri the next year, she became a proud winner of the 2005 World Athletics Final gold when she was upgraded to the title following the disqualification of Tatyana Kotova of Russia by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for testing positive for a prohibited substance. </p><p class="body"> Kotova and five other athletes tested positive in re-tests done in 2013 by the IAAF on samples taken during the 2005 World championships. The Russian was disqualified in the World championships in Helsinki and was also disqualified in the subsequent World Athletics Final in Monaco the same year, in the process upgrading Anju&#8217;s silver to gold. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Only the Olympics medal is missing in my collection; an important medal that is. The competition level at the World championships and Olympics are same but still. Having said that, I have, to tell you honestly, no regrets at all,&#8221; says Anju. There is no reason to disbelieve her as she keeps giggling and laughing right through the conversation. </p><p class="body"> In her best performing year in 2004, Anju finished sixth in the long jump competition at the Athens Olympics, with a national record of 6.83. The subsequent doping disqualification of American Marion Jones pushed Anju up a rung to fifth. </p><p class="body"> Anju had hopes that Kotova (3rd in Athens) and another Russian, Irina Meleshina (nee Simagina), silver medallist, who also had tested positive post-2004, would be disqualified because of their later offences and she would get upgraded to an Olympic medal. Rules, however, do not permit either re-testing of samples or disqualification of results beyond an eight-year period. </p><p class="body"> Some of the 2004 samples were re-tested in 2012 but the Russian long jumpers were not among those caught doping. </p><p class="body"> Because of the rampant use of performance enhancing substances by her rivals, as proved by later events, Anju justifiably felt that she was cheated out of medals during her prime by many of her contemporaries who were high on dope. </p><p class="body"> Anju, a resplendent icon of the sport, confesses to having become &#8220;lazy&#8221; and &#8220;sloppy&#8221; too as far as athletics is concerned. At 37, she is busy nurturing Andrea, her seven-month-old daughter, even as she keeps an eye on the adventurous Aaron, her four-year-old son. Husband Bobby is around to assist but Anju loves the household chores and a composed daily routine, a huge contrast to the punishing schedule she endured when chasing her athletics dreams. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;My lower portion of the body was too long,&#8221; she points out as the reason for her shift to long jump. Obviously it was difficult initially but she found her way. &#8220;I can adapt quickly. I can watch and learn without any coach&#8217;s guidance too. Only when I went to the United States for coaching for the first time that I realised what real athletics was. It was different. Sitting home one can criticise anyone but only when you step out you realise how difficult it is to compete with the rest of the world. I realised I had this special ability to adapt.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> International athletics keeps evolving. Tactics and coaching methods change and differ from coach to coach. Anju adds, &#8220;For me it was easy to notice the changes and new methods, it was a natural thing. Bobby is not like a regular coach. His approach and thoughts are different. He would always tell me that I had to go beyond the Asian level. It was tough in the beginning but soon I realised I could stand along with the rest.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Most top athletes of the world train in US, England, Russia and South Africa. Often, Anju felt the need to prepare for her events in India but the lack of proper coaching support compelled her to abandon such plans. &#8220;We have the basic infrastructure to prosper in athletics but our coaching standards are woefully behind the rest of the world. We are not able to keep pace with the tactical changes and have been following age-old methods of training. That is why I have always insisted that our coaches need to change their mindset. That can happen only by giving our coaches proper exposure. This is one area we have sorely ignored.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Anju&#8217;s newly-attained status of an international gold medallist should inspire women athletics in the country. &#8220;I hope. Today, people know the importance of sports. It helps you become good citizens, gets you admission to prestigious colleges and finally helps you get a job too. Parents are willing to spend time and money on their children if they want to pursue a career in sports. In athletics, women have done extremely well. In badminton and tennis too!&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Is it easy for women to win medals in athletics, badminton and tennis? &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Maybe we are better than men,&#8221; her laughter mirrors her relaxed frame of mind. &#8220;The standard of athletics in India is good only for the Asian level. We are way behind the rest of the world and nothing would make me happier than a woman athlete from India winning an Olympic medal.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> The Kerala-born Anju now lives in Bangalore. She has plans for the future too. &#8220;I certainly look forward to starting an academy in Bangalore. A wellness programme for youth, train athletes in long jump, not necessarily a high performance one, but share my experience.&#8221; Her academy could find branches in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram . For the time being though, she is busy with Aaron and Andrea. They deserve the attention and affection of one of India&#8217;s finest sporting icons. </p><p class="body"> <b>Some of her major achievements</b> </p><p class="body"> - Anju made history when she claimed the long jump bronze medal with a 6.70m leap at the 2003 World Championships in Paris, becoming the first Indian athlete to win a World Championships medal. </p><p class="body"> - Anju finished sixth in the long jump competition at the Athens Olympics in 2004.

These were located very often under normal and legal cafÃ©s and accessible to only members. Often those animated evenings ended with the irruption of the police, an interruption that, luckily does not take place nowadays. </p><p class="body">On the walls of the bar were black and white graphics depicting famous gangsters such as Al Capone and Lucky Luciano along with some short phrases. One such was very interesting and placed just behind the performing musicians and reminded the customers that if they found the music too loud, it means they are too old.</p><p class="body">The first group opened the proceedings with a great piece of the renowned American guitarist John Scofield and for all the performances they kept playing a modern version of Jazz with many Rock influences: the guitar effects and the perfect coordination between the members. All these combined to give the audience the opportunity to hear some very good live music. Several high quality Jazz pieces incorporated fusion with other styles such as R&amp;B and Funk. </p><p class="body">The drums and the guitars during the celebration brought out some rhythm and judging by head movements and finger snapping of the audience seemed to indicate enjoyment by them. Patrons kept walking in the club and, in the middle of the session, there was hardly space for the waiters to reach the tables. </p><p class="body">High quality music, a sizeable crowed and a cheerful atmosphere contributed to render justice to the International Jazz Day, testifying once more that the genre is still popular and its lovers are rapidly increasing in the Capital. </p><hr><h1>A different experience</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 18:10 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">Five years ago, I visited a friend in Mumbai, and chanced upon a Bohri wedding that was taking place in her neighbourhood. Invited for the celebrations, I found myself tasting Bohri food for the first time.The flavour of the food stayed with me, and years later, I got the opportunity in Delhi to revisit the taste when I got an invitation from K3 restaurant at JW Marriott to attend a Bohri Food Festival.</p><p class="body">I was introduced to Chef Musakir Khan, in town from Mumbai to organise the festival. Before the meal, the Chef explains Bohri food to me. He says, &#8220;A Bohri meal starts with a pinch of salt and is followed by sweet dishes. Traditional Bohri food is eaten by eight people from a large plate. It gives the feeling of community eating.&#8221;After the pinch of salt, I startmy meal with Malida. It is a suji dish, mixed with eggs and boiled milk, and then fried with ghee and melted jaggery and dry fruits. Chef Khan has more than 16 years of experience with Bohri food. His knowledge of the cuisine is amazing. Explaining the speciality of the cuisine further, he says, &#8220;We use very little spice and oil in our food. We don&#8217;t use red chillies.&#8221; </p><p class="body">The next round of dishes arrives, which includes nargis kabab, meat cutlet, chicken patty and kokum batata. The non-vegetarian starters are succulent and tender. My main course comprises the popular dabba gosht and mutton biryani. In dabba gosht, mutton pieces are marinated in ginger, garlic and chilli, stewed with whole spices in a cashew and onion gravy, topped with an egg and baked. The meat is boiled to make it tender and then cut into small pieces. Then macaroni, egg and cashew are added to the mix before it&#8217;s put in the oven. The dish is very different from the usual non-vegetarian fare, and highly enjoyable. The mutton biryani is also quite different from the ones we usually find in restaurants. In this version, the garlic and ginger are added before the Dum is put in. &#8220;Only those people can make the perfect Bohri food who have knowledge and understanding of this cuisine. And perfection comes with years of experience, as well as spending time with this Bohra community,&#8221; adds Chef Khan.</p><p class="body"><i>This fest ends on May 4. Meal for two: 3300 plus taxes</i></p><hr><h1>The Queen of May</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 16:38 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">As we enter the month of May, with roses blooming all over and May Queen contests being planned in hotels, restaurants, clubs and residential colonies, one&#8217;s thoughts go back to the 1890s which saw Delhi&#8217;s first May Queen being selected. This is as per hear-say. Some however claim that the first such event did not take place during the viceroyalty of Lord Curzon but when Lord Lytton as Governor-General came here in 1877. </p><p class="body">Going by what Norah Nicholson used to say till her death as a nonagenarian many years ago, the first May Ball was held at Ludlow Castle, where the European Club had been moved from the Town Hall because of a plague epidemic scare in 1898. She had, as a young girl, heard from her grannies that the function saw the crowning of Miss Ball as May Queen. Could have been a memory lapse for the contest winner&#8217;s father (Ball Sahib) was a noted magistrate at Agra in early 20th Century and later migrated to South Africa where he set up a lucrative legal practice. His daughter (living in the house on the hill) became May Queen in the city of the Taj in the 1920s, long after the famous contest was held at the Savoy in Mussoorie. According to the late Mrs Roberts, born in 1880, the name of the dimpled girl who won the title in Delhi was Heather Jones, and when she was crowned her admirers went wild with joy, while her rival Charmain Miller&#8217;s supporters gulped down their disappointment with large pegs of whisky on a night which was unexpectedly cool for that part of the year because of a strong breeze blowing from the Ridge.</p><p class="body">Among those present were the Houghtons, Campbells, a visiting writer, Miss Saunders, Mr Maidens, who founded Maidens Hotel, a number of CMS clergymen and a Catholic priest of St Mary&#8217;s Church. This reverend Father impressed on the gathering that the first-ever May Queen was the Virgin Mary, to whom the month of May is devoted. Present also were the proprietors of London Stores, Spencer&#8217;s and Carlton&#8217;s from Kashmere Gate. Some Punjabi Muslim shoe merchants (who came to Delhi during the time of Shah Alam) and the Khatri businessmen, who settled down during the reign of Shah Jahan, also managed to enter Ludlow Castle hall. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that the Qaum Punjabian&#8217;s main face at that time was the Hanafi Siddiqui, whose family was more interested in setting up printing presses, madrasas and building mosques. The Khatris were headed by Lala Chunna Mal who, along with other elite, both Muslim and Hindu, used to &#8220;take the air&#8221; in the spacious Kashmere Gate area, then the lungs of the city. The most boisterous were the Tommies from the Red Fort and Daryaganj. They had come in their one-horse carriages, sounding trumpets, blowing whistles and raising hurrahs before parking their Ticca gharries at the hackney carriage stand on Ludlow Castle Road, which continued to exist till the early 1970s.</p><p class="body">If one were to go by the treatise, &#8220;Delhi between Two Empires&#8221;, that was the time when many of the Mirzas and Mirs had come down a step or two from their high pedestal to become school teachers and clerks because of income constraints. Better off than them were the karkhandars or owners of small factories. One wonders how many of these neo-rich managed to be at the club which had presumably relaxed its rules for the much-touted May Queen show. According to historian Naryani Gupta, the Civil Lines had ceased to be the main residential area for the Europeans by then and &#8220;second-class Europeans&#8221; had begun to settle down north of Qudsia Garden and Nicholson Park. They were mostly Telegraph and Railway employees, like the ones depicted in the film &#8220;Julie&#8221;, in which Om Prakash plays the role of a bottle-happy Anglo-Indian dad. To select the May Queen may not have been the railwaymen&#8217;s prerogative but their presence at the renamed Delhi Club could not be overlooked as Heather&#8217;s father was a senior railway engine driver. Charmain Miller, first runner-up &#8220;and taller by far, burst into tears, burying her sweet face in her delicate hands as her boyfriend tried to comfort her with umpteen kisses,&#8221; recalled Mrs Roberts in the 1960s. The May Queen contests now are more lavish and popular but somehow one always thinks that the cultural pastures were greener when the Civil Lines was the centre of fashion, with hotels like Lauries, Cecil, Suisse and Maidens vying with each other. Railwaymen did not usually frequent them but still they formed an influential community since New Year&#8217;s Eve 1867, when the first train arrived in Delhi and its whistle was heard in the Walled City.</p><hr><h1>Clicking for a calling</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 18:11 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">It&#8217;s noontime, baking hot, and I am passing by India Gate in New Delhi in an air-conditioned car. Thank God for it! Peeping out, I see the barricaded road leading to the early 19th Century monument &#8212; popular on tourists&#8217; to-do list otherwise &#8212; nearly deserted. Who visits a roasting Delhi in May-June, after all? </p><p class="body">And then I catch this sight &#8212; a bunch of eager beavers. With cameras hanging round their neck, they form an uneven line, just where the police barricade starts on the stretch of Rajpath that ends at the Gate, each flashing sample photos from albums. Pretty palpable is their hope for the odd tourist to arrive and hire their services. </p><p class="body">No, they are neither a new phenomenon at India Gate nor have I spotted them for the first time. In fact, I remember reading a news item some time last year that the photographers of India Gate had been barred from entering the area. So they are back now! </p><p class="body">A parallel thought also hits my head: even in the best of weather, who gets a photo clicked by them at a time when even the cheapest mobile phones have in-built cameras? </p><p class="body">The question needs an answer, and I soon find myself amid them. They take me for that one odd tourist they have been waiting for; offer to click my photo with the edifice as the backdrop. &#8220;Rs.30, 40 or 50? See samples, photo in two minutes,&#8221; the offer is concise. &#8220;One for the memory, madam,&#8221; they try their luck.</p><p class="body">I pose the niggling question to them. Soon names get exchanged, a conversation ensues and in that stream bobs the answer. Rather, the constant struggle, to find the answer. Impressive is their everyday fight to keep the means of livelihood ticking, even in the harshest of environments</p><p class="body">&#8220;We are nearly 200 of us here. Every day, by 10 o&#8217; clock, we arrive here hoping to make some money,&#8221; says Salim. No, he doesn&#8217;t own the camera, a Nikon D3000. &#8220;We are all employed by a group of people, some get a daily wage from them, some others get commission for photos clicked,&#8221; says the Sangam Vihar resident. </p><p class="body">Summer is a terrible time for them. &#8220;In this heat, we wait the whole day. Hardly anybody comes,&#8221; states Salim&#8217;s mate Ajay. Ajay belongs to a U.P. village. &#8220;There is nothing there for me; I am somehow hanging on here. My neighbour in the rented room in Mandawali is in this job; he brought me to the employer three years ago,&#8221; he says. In tourist season, each of these men &#8212; in their 20s and 30s &#8212; earns between Rs. 5000 and 6000 per month. In summers, the amount dwindles to around Rs.4000. Pointing at another photographer, Salim says, &#8220;Vinod is married, has two children, it becomes very difficult for him at times.&#8221;</p><p class="body">So how do they manage to deliver a photo to a tourist in two minutes? &#8220;We bring printers with us. There are about 40 portable printers at this point of time on the India Gate lawns,&#8221; pipes up photographer Sonu. No, they don&#8217;t own the printers either. Sonu points out a man standing some distance away, saying, &#8220;He is my employer. You can talk to him.&#8221; </p><p class="body">The man &#8212; seemingly in his late 30s &#8212; identifies himself as Sandeep Rajput. &#8220;We have been in this business for the last 8-10 years. I have grown up playing at India Gate; my father, grandfather were balloon sellers here,&#8221; says Sandeep. His interest lies in outdoor photography, but he has not got a break yet. &#8220;I am carrying on here like this, can earn at the most Rs.15,000 per month,&#8221; he says.</p><p class="body">Camera phones indeed put a spanner in his business. So does Police harassment. &#8220;We have to pay policemen every day to be here,&#8221; he says. In an attempt to join hands &#8220;to get permission from the authorities, maybe an I-D card,&#8221; 36 such &#8216;employers&#8217; came together two-three years ago to form a union, he says. &#8220;It is a registered body named Photographer Welfare Association.&#8221;</p><p class="body">Mukesh Kumar, the union president, says the biggest blow was when the Police banned their entry to the area just after the December 16 rape case. &#8220;When we came back, there were other people operating in collusion with some policemen.&#8221; They have been trying to approach Delhi Tourism, the New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Police, for permission to be on the lawns. &#8220;We also did dharna in front of Sonia Gandhi&#8217;s house, Sheila Dikshit&#8217;s house,&#8221; relates Mukesh.</p><p class="body">&#8220;NDMC told us, fill forms, we will give you kiosks. It has been over a year now,&#8221; says Mukesh&#8217;s senior union colleague Sandeep. &#8220;We have never done anything illegal here. In fact, a fellow photographer, Raju, has been awarded a tamra patra by the Police Commissioner for alerting them about a bomb at India Gate some time ago,&#8221; points out Santosh, a senior union colleague. </p><p class="body">Santosh has some fond childhood memories of India Gate. His father was also a balloon seller. &#8220;Those days, cars were allowed on this road. When it rained, we would run to one of the rooms under India Gate. Once, a bunch of us climbed till the top of the Gate,&#8221; he recalls, laughing. </p><p class="body">NDMC has recently employed a private guard agency to help maintain security in and around India Gate. You can spot the men in uniform with sticks in hand moving about. &#8220;Their job is to chase us away, people who try and make a living by selling balloons, water bottles, a photograph for a memory. Each of these 36 union members employs at least five young men. So you can imagine how many people are depending on this means of livelihood,&#8221; says the old man. Before he walks away, he tells me something one can&#8217;t disagree with, &#8220;Those in authority should realise that the easiest thing to do is to crush those who don&#8217;t have a voice.&#8221; </p><p class="body">Meanwhile, tomorrow is another day for Sonu, Salim and his ilk. </p><hr><h1>Assam violence aimed at full-fledged communal flare-up: Shinde</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 16:32 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> With <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/assam-violence-nine-more-bodies-recovered-in-baksa-district/article5972576.ece" target="_parent">32 people being killed in Assam</a>, the Centre on Sunday said it is determined to curb attacks on minorities as the violence was aimed at starting a &#8220;full-fledged communal conflagration&#8221;. </p><p class="body"> Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said that in the last few days, there have been wanton acts of depredation leading to death of 32 people, mostly women and children, and of them, 31 belonged to the <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gogoi-seeks-nia-probe-into-assam-violence/article5973403.ece" target="_parent">minority community</a>. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;These innocent lives were lost at the hands of cadres of certain group. The objective of this group seems to be aimed at starting a full-fledged communal conflagration,&#8221; he said in a statement in New Delhi. </p><p class="body"> Without name NDFB(S), the Bodo militant group believed to be responsible for the violence, the Home Minister said these acts of violence have started only after the group started steadily losing its cadres either through surrender or elimination during operations when they opened fire on the forces. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;The central government cannot remain unaffected by these killings and is determined to ensure the safety and security of innocent human lives. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;This determination is all the more important since these incidents are targeted at the minorities,&#8221; he said. </p><p class="body"> Strongly condemning the acts of the militant group, Mr. Shinde said the Home Ministry has already deployed 43 companies (4300 personnel) of central armed police forces and 10 more companies (1000 personnel) are being sent. </p><p class="body"> He said Ministry of Defence also has deployed 15 columns of the army comprising of approximately 1500 soldiers. </p><p class="body"> These numbers are not fixed and can be increased as per further requirement, he said. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;My appeal to all is to maintain calm and quiet as the forces on the ground will definitely control the situation and bring the guilty to justice,&#8221; Mr. Shinde said. </p><p class="body"> He said the public leaders of both Bodo and minority community must see to it that the situation does not deteriorate. </p><p class="body"> The violence has so far claimed 32 lives in three Bodo-dominated districts -- Kokrajhar, Chirang and Baska -- in Assam in last three days. </p><p class="body"> The Assam government has sought an NIA probe into the violence. Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has promised to hunt down those involved in the killings. </p><hr><h1>Flavours of its own</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 16:32 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">Rosang CafÃ© is a journey of the passion and hard work of a woman who came to Delhi from Mizoram a decade ago with her baby in her lap. She always wanted to give her daughter a good education and exposure to grow in life. Mary Lalboi opted to serve people with food of all the Northeastern States. </p><p class="body">New to Delhi, she first started at Safdarjung with a small eatery. Mary recalls, &#8220;When a customer asked for water, I used to say &#8216;Fridge is on the left, go get it&#8217;, as my baby used to be in my lap all the time.&#8221; That&#8217;s a glimpse of the homely environment which Rosang is famous for. Then she shifted to Hauz Khas village market, which made Mary quite popular amongst youngsters. Mary, who was very active on Facebook, started uploading pictures of prominent people who used to visit the cafÃ© quite often. But as sealing issues cropped up, Mary had to shut Rosang for the second time. But nothing could dent her passion and zeal and now she is back with a much bigger outlet next to the Green Park metro station. </p><p class="body">As soon as I entered, I saw Mary sitting in a corner wearing a traditional North Eastern costume. Simple wooden furniture and pictures of the North East make up the ambience. The menu has all the major dishes from the eight States. Chicken dry, fried and stuffed with sesame seeds was my first bite and it impressed me with its flavours and crunchy yet juicy texture. Maroi bora, Manipuri style fritters, with chives from Manipur, also had a very distinct flavour. Tokhan, a chicken curry from Tripura, aksa meh with seasonal herbs, was redolent with flavours and went well with wild rice, a specialty of Rosang. Worth a mention is iromba chutney made out of fish paste which goes well with everything. There are no lamb or mutton dishes on the menu. </p><p class="body">Two points to keep in mind: Rosang&#8217;s flavours are for people with an evolved palate. Secondly, end your meal with a wild rice kheer whenever you visit Rosang.</p><p class="body"><i>Meal for two &#8211; Rs.600</i></p><hr><h1>History in paintings</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 16:28 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">Quieter and quainter a museum, more interesting it turns out to be. And the Capital is full of them. Bhai Mati Dass Museum in Chandni Chowk, our focus this week, is one such space. Surrounded by the hustle bustle of Chandni Chowk, a stone&#8217;s throw from Sisganj Gurdwara which is thronged by thousands of devotees everyday and five minutes away from Chandni Chowk Metro station ensuring a continuous stream of people, the museum appears like an oasis.</p><p class="body">The museum is named after Bhai Mati Dass &#8212; a disciple of Guru Tegh Bahadur &#8212; who was cut into two pieces right at this site. Despite the busy intersection (Bhai Mati Dass Chowk) drawing its name from the same historical figure after whom is named the museum, it still sounds news to many. That the chowk has the famous Victorian period fountain should have lent it even greater recall value but these factors didn&#8217;t integrate to produce the expected result. But the truth is that Bhai Mati Dass Museum has existed at the site, in the same structure since 2000. Before that the building was home to Majestic Cinema.</p><p class="body">As I frequent the museums in the city, I realise accessibility is definitely not the issue for there are hardly any museum which are in the back of beyond. Couple of hours that I spent at the museum, it received five visitors. But the visitors weren&#8217;t there just for the museum. They were curious devotees who had come to the gurdwara and decided to just drop in. Engrossed, they carefully read the detailed captions in Gurmukhi (it has captions in Hindi and English too) and then engaged in short conversations about the same.</p><p class="body">As experts across the globe mull over repositioning these institutions so as to fit them into altered worlds of today, there has emerged space for different kinds of museums to coexist. And it is in here that this museum belongs to.</p><p class="body">The museum, managed by Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Committee, is opened 365 days. The visitors need to walk inside with their heads covered. And there is an inn right above the museum. While these aspects set it apart from other museums in the city, the 100-150 paintings dealing with Sikh history put it back within the traditionally known purview of museums. Realistically painted canvases construct the Sikh history narrative with much verve. Brightly painted works narrate the story of Sikhism and as it grew under the guidance of 10 gurus. Significant scenes &#8212; both known and unknown &#8212; drawn from guru&#8217;s lives capture the attention of the onlooker.</p><p class="body">The paintings not only focus on the gurus but have sections dedicated to other important figures like Baba Budha ji, Sain Mian Mir (a famous Sufi saint who laid the foundation stone of Hari Mandir Sahib), Mata Sundari Kaur (wife of Guru Gobind Singh) Rani Jindan (wife of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and mother of Maharaja Duleep Singh and various other women, who played important roles in Sikh history, important battles like Battle of Bhangani (battle fought by Guru Gobind Singh).</p><p class="body">And not far from the entrance is the section dedicated to Bhai Mati Dass, Bhai Sati Dass, Bhai Dyal Dass depicted being martyred as their guru Tegh Bahadur watched on in custody right at the same spot where stands the museum. Guru Tegh Bahadur was then beheaded at the same spot.</p><p class="body">&#8220;While some artists were commissioned to do these paintings by the committee, some like Sobha Singh ji donated their works,&#8221; says Iqbal Singh, a senior museum official. With bright colours, a stress on facial expressions and poignancy, the simplistic works immediately strike a chord with the viewer. &#8220;Sikhism doesn&#8217;t allow us to make films on our gurus. So how do we tell the youngsters about its origins and the history? Through literature and art. We have a library too and there is this museum. Now, we are planning to connect it to take it closer to the gurdwara so that it gets more visitors,&#8221; he adds. </p><hr><h1>Landslide on NMR track</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 16:28 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> A landslide partially hit train services on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) on Sunday. Railway sources told <i>The Hindu</i> that due to a downpour on Saturday evening in Coonoor and some places below a landslip had occurred on the track at Adderlie. As a result the Coonoor bound train from Mettupalayam with a large number of tourists had to be stopped near Adderlie and sent back. They were put on buses and sent to their destinations. With railway staff clearing the track the Coonoor-Mettupalayam train began services in the afternoon.</p><hr><h1>In the jungle, the mighty jungleâ€¦</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 16:19 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">It&#8217;s 5 am. The sleepy Nizamuddin railway station is beginning to stir, and only half awake, I have somehow managed to find my seat on the Nizamuddin-Kota Superfast, though it&#8217;s taken me a while. Four women, one child and a half empty bag of Cheetos greet me. I begin to wake up; taking in the faces and names of people I will be travelling with. Five women, strangers to each other, have signed up with Soul Purpose Travel&#8217;s trip to Rajasthan&#8217;s Ranthambore National Park, hoping for a short but wonderful holiday, and making a few more friends along the way.</p><p class="body">A jerk, hiss and scrape later, the train&#8217;s on its way to Sawai Madhopur, home to the famous tiger reserve. It will take us six hours to get there. Meanwhile, Vidya Deshpande and Mimi Chakrabarti use the time to distribute bags filled with Soul Purpose merchandise to us, and as we examine the colourful coasters and badges, they tell us about the company they started a year back, one that is already on its eleventh trip. Based out of Gurgaon, Soul Purpose Travel is an adventure travel company for women, and every month, it organises one adventure holiday. &#8220;We try to visit lesser known, offbeat places. And when we visit common holiday spots, we try to approach the place differently, arranging activities that are unusual and exciting&#8221;, says Deshpande. Advertising through word of mouth and social networking platforms, Soul Purpose has undertaken trips to places such as Bharatpur, Bandavgarh National Park, Nagaland, Munsiyari, Jageshwar and Khajuraho. &#8220;We try to keep the group small, making the trip both easier to handle and also intimate&#8221;, adds Chakrabarti. Over the hours, the conversation ebbs and flows, and each topic comes back to that one thing. On our way to one of the largest national parks in North India, of course we have tigers on our minds. </p><p class="body">It is said, and rightly so, that the tigers in Ranthambore are the most camera friendly ones in the world. With the heat turned up, the deciduous forest dry, and over 50 tigers on the prowl for shade and water, our chances of spotting one, I am told, are high. The park is open to visitors from 1st October to 30th June every year, and Soul Purpose has chosen what is considered the best month to plan a trip into the forest. </p><p class="body">Reaching Ranthambore from Delhi, I realise, is fairly easy. The Superfast gets us to the Sawai Madhopur station at 11 am on a Friday morning. Our rides to the Pugmarks Resort are open jeeps, the preferred mode of travel in this Tiger City. The sun is strong, but the light gust of wind surprisingly cool. The vast, desert flatland that surrounds us is overwhelming. So far removed from the city we have left behind, it seems to reinforce the fact that we are, after all, on a holiday.</p><p class="body">The almost empty roads, dotted infrequently with canters and jeeps rushing past, curves into the dusty, unpaved path that leads to the resort. Surrounded by acres of land, Pugmarks is a bit like a cool, green haven. We look longingly towards the pool, but there&#8217;s a safari waiting for us and our window of time to prepare for it is short. A quick lunch and shower later, we have sunscreens, hats and cameras in place. </p><p class="body">The safaris in the park are scheduled twice daily &#8212; early morning and late afternoon &#8212; and they last for three and a half hours. The park is huge, located at the junction of the Aravalli and Vindhya hill range and covering an area of approximately 400 sq km. A short ten to fifteen minute ride brings us to its entrance. A family of common langurs or Hanumans greet us, and the safari begins.</p><p class="body">Before the trip, a look at the itinerary had assured me that this was a well planned, balanced trip, with three safaris, plenty of food and rest, and some shopping and sight-seeing. Now, on our first safari, we enter the deep, seemingly never-ending forest. In the first half hour, overwhelmed by the foliage, the forest cover largely made up of palash or dhok, we spot langurs, sanguine looking spotted deer, nilgais and at least three different kind of beautiful birds, including the ubiquitous tree pie. The bright orange-red flowers of the dhok tree are gorgeous against the backdrop of a dry forest land. While we are still softly exclaiming at a deer delicately sipping water from a pool, our jeep&#8217;s radio crackles to life &#8212; there has been a sighting.</p><p class="body">The mere whiff of a &#8220;sighting&#8221; (the word used only to refer to tiger appearances) is enough to send excited ripples travelling through the forest. There is hushed chatter, and the canters and jeeps communicate with each other, exchanging information rapidly. What is heartening is the wonder and excitement, laced with affection, that runs through the guides and drivers. The tigers have been given fond names &#8212; Machhli, Star, Sultan&#8212; and each sighting makes for stories that last weeks. Swept up in the excitement, our jeep gathers speed, racing towards the spot of the sighting, and, once we reach it, the spot of a traffic jam. Everyone wants a glimpse of the sleeping tiger, down in the ravine, inside his cool, cosy cave, oblivious to the excitement above. He sleeps, and we stare at him. &#8220;T-28&#8221; is beautiful. Long, lean, almost completely hidden from view but still intimidating, he obliges us by lifting a heavy paw to swat a fly. We sigh, our day made.</p><p class="body">It only gets better though. Our first safari brings us a bagful of sightings, and we even manage to spot a leopard. &#8220;Thieves, these ones,&#8221; our driver tells us, affection softening his words. &#8220;They are impossible to track properly, masters that they are at hide and seek&#8221;. This makes the leopard sighting even more valuable, and we take countless pictures of this animal, still as a rock, almost entirely camouflaged by the bush he sits behind. A couple of snub nosed marsh crocodiles are next, along with the blackbuck and an Indian wild boar. Before long, it&#8217;s time to return, but not before T-28, awake now, graces us with another look-see. He appears quite suddenly, and walks with our jeep, stretching luxuriously, yawning and licking his paws. We follow him, keeping only a foot or so between him and the jeep, till he finally gets bored of us and disappears into the jungle.</p><p class="body">We are almost completely silent on our way back to the resort. The excited chatter has died away, replaced by a silent awe. The jungle, it turns out, can do this to you, and its impossible to not be deeply impressed by the beauty and power that it hides within. A meal of the traditional daal-baati-choorma rounds things off fabulously. </p><p class="body">The next day, we take a trip to the Ranthambore Fort, steeped with and boasting a long, complicated history rife with succession battles and intrigue. On our way back, we intend to make a quick stop at the Dastakar store, but the visit proves to be long, leaving our luggage heavier and wallets lighter. The Dastakar society, founded in 1981 to help craftspeople, especially women, use their own traditional craft skills as a means of employment, income generation and economic self-sufficiency, produces beautiful, colourful things that are nearly impossible to resist.</p><p class="body">The last day of the trip, complete with another fruitful safari sans tiger sightings, and a much needed break inside the resort, ends with a night drive to the station. Our train is scheduled to arrive at 10:40 pm, and we leave the resort early enough for a last, pitch black and slow drive through the almost deserted roads; early enough to spot the lone hyena making his way into the forest.</p><hr><h1>Native textiles, western sensibilities</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 16:14 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Handloom retail giant Fabindia sprung a surprise recently when it announced the launch of a western line of garments, Fabels, in cotton and khadi, made possible with design intervention by French designer Alistair Blair, who has been associated with labels such as Dior and Valentino. Eager to diversify from ethnic wear the brand is known for, Fabindia hopes to reach out to younger clients who look at high-end labels for dresses, jackets, palazzos, shirts and skirts. </p><p class="body"> In its first phase, the label will be available in cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai and eventually across the country. This maybe a significant step for a retail major in the handloom sector, but closer home, enterprising designers have been in the innovating mode for a while now. </p><p class="body"> <b>Style and comfort</b><br/> <br/> In February, Sunaina Sood launched her collection in khadi, in silhouettes ranging from ethnic to fusion. &#8220;I had seen enough of nets and georgettes,&#8221; she says, talking about her shift to khadi. Known for quirky garments, she tried to do the same using khadi. &#8220;In my school days, I associated cotton and khadi with Shabana Azmi. Today we see college-goers and young working women buying cotton garments but they want both comfort and style,&#8221; she observes. </p><p class="body"> Sunaina says experimenting with handlooms has its own challenges. &#8220;I used five different textures of khadi, sourced from Ponduru, Hyderabad and Bangalore. The drapes required a certain variety of khadi and a structured outfit warranted something else,&#8221; she says. The line included ghararas, outfits inspired by Hyderabadi khara dupatta, short and long dresses. All this comes at a price. &#8220;It&#8217;s a myth that handlooms are cheap. Despite that, I feel youngsters will accept handlooms if you use the fabric to create new silhouettes. They are likely to pick up a garment for its style than heritage value,&#8221; she says. </p><p class="body"> Aravind Joshua agrees that not every youngster holds hand-spun khadi in reverence. &#8220;If you cannot reach out to them through the philosophy of khadi, do it with design,&#8221; he says. He observes that khadi was considered a fabric fit for an age group above 50 when he began designing and since then, has noticed a steady shift to make it accessible to the 20s and 30s. </p><p class="body"> <b>Social attitudes</b><br/> <br/> M.V. Chandrashekar and his business partner Ravi of Metaphor Racha, have been giving khadi-cotton an urbane look without compromising its ethos. They design tops, tunics, dresses, jackets and trousers apart from khadi saris. </p><p class="body"> Chandrashekar doesn&#8217;t go by changing trends. &#8220;We look at fashion in the broader sense, stemming from an understanding of textiles. Women are individualistic and want clothes to reflect their personality. So innovating with handlooms is not merely about designing new garments, it&#8217;s about catering to this attitude change,&#8221; he points out. </p><p class="body"> <b>Pricing matters</b><br/> <br/> Sharmila Nagraj Nandula, who showcased evening gowns in khadi at the International Workshop on Natural Dyes in Hyderabad and launched a line of crushed skirts, feels the college-going age group prefers a larger wardrobe at affordable prices, a tough task for the handloom sector. &#8220;Fab India&#8217;s new move is a great idea; it will be interesting to see if they can make this western line affordable. Youngsters want quantity. In cities like Mumbai and Delhi, they are happy shopping at Fashion Street and Sarojini Market,&#8221; she says. </p><p class="body"> For most designers, ethnic wear is the mainstay as the revenue comes in from a mature clientele that understands and pays for handlooms. </p><p class="body"> For instance Sashikant Naidu, known for his line of saris in hand-woven khadi and silks, has also designed chic khadi dresses and tunics. &#8220;One has to innovate, but we designers will not able to match the pricing of a retail brand simply because we don&#8217;t mass produce. I&#8217;ve had young women asking for my khadi dresses. But that&#8217;s a small segment,&#8221; he says. </p><p class="body"> How far will Fabels be able to tap the college-going age group is something the design fraternity would like to wait and observe. </p><hr><h1>The drama in banquets and feasts </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 16:03 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">The setting is Elizabethan England. A feast is on. A grand pie is brought in, with much fanfare, on to a table laden with food. When sliced open little black birds fly out dramatically leaving diners enthralled. &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s how a certain pie was made and that&#8217;s how the rhyme - four and twenty black birds baked in a pie - came about,&#8221; says Miranda Lapworth smiling at the disbelief that appears on the faces of her listeners. </p><p class="body">Miranda, a writer, director, and drama coach, is completing her book on symbolism of food in Shakespeare to be published by the year end. She is in India as part of the world premiere of her play, <i>Bharat, Blighty and The Bard, Shakespeare for Everyone, </i>a collaboration between her and veteran actor Madhav Sharma. </p><p class="body">Elizabethan food has been a popular subject of several books but Miranda&#8217;s endeavours are singular as they delve into the cuisines of the different lands that the dramas were set in. Hence, ancient Roman food, Scottish cuisine and Asian influences along with Elizabethan food are part of the research. &#8220;What I have done is to study the role of food in the 37 plays by Shakespeare, of how food symbolically is an active ingredient in plot development, in signalling action, in predicting possible denouncements and in delineating characters.&#8221;</p><p class="body">Miranda&#8217;s interest in food began young while she cooked in the kitchen following instructions of her mother who sat at the dining table studying for her degree exams. &#8220;I liked to get the recipes right,&#8221; recalls Miranda. If her mother taught her cooking it was her father, the late Shakespearean scholar Paul Lapworth, who encouraged her to write the book as it combined her twin passions &#8211; Shakespeare and food. The immediate inspiration was watching <i>Macbeth</i>, when Banquo&#8217;s ghost leapt on to the dining table. Miranda was struck by the idea, &#8220;I thought the setting over a meal was very clever, that food was a foil for subliminal action.&#8221; </p><p class="body">Miranda divides food into nine categories from its appearance in the plays. The most obvious overture of food is during a celebration with other instances being cancelled feasts, withdrawal of food, reward with food and such.</p><p class="body">In <i>Much Ado About Nothing </i>a feast thrown by Leonato has the ominous portent of being smashed. It shows clearly that good characters have hearty appetites and bad ones suffer from poor appetite and digestion.</p><p class="body">A celebration is cancelled in <i>All&#8217;s Well That End&#8217;s Well </i>signalling the couple&#8217;s unhappy future. Food is used effectively as a symbol of love and seduction in <i>Antony and Cleopatra </i>where it suggests amorous activities behind closed doors. Deception is planned over food in <i>Macbeth</i>. It is used as reward and punishment for sin in <i>The Tempest</i>. Abstinence or withdrawal from food is symbolic of trouble. &#8220;Hamlet is so chewed up by grief that he cannot eat.&#8221;</p><p class="body">The most dramatic use is in Shakespeare&#8217;s bloodiest play <i>Titus Andronicus</i> where a horrific pie cooked with meat of the villains is served to their mother, the queen. Here food is a symbol of revenge and death. </p><p class="body">Interpretation of food in classical literature, as in this one, comes with question of validity and intent. Miranda says, &#8220;What seems important to me is that Shakespeare knew details of food to use it naturally in text. He is very aware of the implications of what to eat.&#8221;</p><p class="body">So a feast then is not a modern day banquet. The two have vastly different connotations. A first course in a Shakespearean feast would be a spread of 30 to 40 dishes and &#8220;not small ones&#8221;. The piece de resistance would be roast meats of boar and birds like peacocks, capon and swan. &#8220;<i>Eight wild boars roasted whole at breakfast</i>,&#8221; says Enobarbus in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>. Sugar that had just arrived in England was a status symbol. &#8220;The Elizabethans did not segregate sweet from savoury and hence a chicken dish had sugar and spices in it. They were skilled at flavouring meat and salt cod was very popular. Vegetables and salads were for peasants,&#8221; says Miranda. </p><p class="body">Corn, though mentioned in the plays, did not exist. It is used as a term for grains. There were classes of bread.

Cherian put his money and efforts into film production. Cherian was fully involved in theatre and also owned Royal Photo Studio in Ernakulam. </p><p class="body"> Cherian spearheaded Sanmargaposhini Nataka Sabha and devoted all his efforts in the growth of this theatre group. Their play, <i>Mishiha Charitham</i> was extremely popular in Cochin and Travancore. In fact, this landmark play had a record 320 staging in a year. The play also brought in revenue for Cherian enabling him to dream of making a film. </p><p class="body"> After <i>Njanambika</i> for a rather long interval there were hardly any Malayalam films. Theatres began screening Tamil films during this time. It was at this juncture that Cherian decided to take the plunge into making a Malayalam movie. As advised by his friends and well-wishers he decided to make a family film that would bring back the audiences that had gradually begun to keep away from the movie halls. </p><p class="body"> Cherian&#8217;s studio became a hub for cinema discussion every evening. As a first step, Cherian floated a company called &#8216;Kerala Talkies&#8217;. Chevalier C.P. Lonappan, Ismael Haji Eesa Sett (grandfather of Kanmani Babu, producer of <i>Chemmeen</i>), Padmanabha Shenoy (owner of Shenoys group of theatres), Dr.Usman Khan, C.A. Ouseph, P.V.Kurian, Dr.Abraham Mampally, Muhammed Quasim, Abdul Sathar Sett, Kochu Pareeth were the other shareholders of Kerala Talkies. They raised a working capital of nearly two lakh rupees. </p><p class="body"> The company decided to complete and release the film <i>Nirmala </i>in four months. Cherian also planned to make at least three films every year. The story was by M.S. Jacob and P.V. Krishnan was contracted as director. Puthezhathu Raman Menon, a renowned writer and Chief Secretary of the erstwhile Cochin State, agreed to pen the script. P.K. Warrier and P.S. Divakar composed 12 songs written by G.Sankara Kurup. Modern Studio, Salem, was the venue for the shoot. </p><p class="body"> <i>Nirmala</i> was the first Malayalam film to introduce playback singing. T.K. Govinda Rao, C. Sarojini Menon and P. Leela were the singers. G.Rangarajan cranked the camera, editing was by Balu, costumes by Manikam, sound recording by S. Padmanabhan and K.S. Mani. The key roles were played by Cherian&#8217;s eldest son Joseph and Joseph's wife Baby. Cherthala Vasudeva Kurup, Mathappan, Bhaskaran Nair, Raghavan, N.R. Panchanathan, P.J. Varkey, Anthappan, S.J. Dev, Kumari Radha, Achamma, Kuttiyamma, Thresiamma, Kamalamma, Vimalamma, Gracy and Gouri Santhi completed the cast. </p><p class="body"> The recording was done at Modern Theatres, Salem. Work on many films was on at the studio at the same time and Cherian had to wait for months for his turn. He was forced to sell some his property and even pawned his studio to complete his film. The distribution rights were given to a film industrialist K.V. Koshy. In November 1947 Cherian lost his wife. In February 1948, <i>Nirmala </i>was released. </p><p class="body"> The film flopped at the box office. Though the film got a mixed response it ran into rough weather because of the huge expenditure that went into the making of the film. One reason for this was the cost involved in the payment to the cast and crew for the few years of the production. The expenses of running the company and shooting for more than two years, interests on the loan that Cherian had taken caused a huge hole in his finances. </p><p class="body"> Cherian was the first person from the State to produce a film, the first to cast his own son and daughter-in-law in the main roles and the first to introduce playback singing in Malayalam cinema. </p><p class="body"> <i>(Saju Chelangad is a film columnist.)</i> </p><hr><h1>Marad probe: BJP asks CM to clarify </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 14:55 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">The State president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), V. Muraleedharan, has asked Chief Minister Oommen Chandy to clarify on the statement made by the former Crime Branch-Crime Investigation Department Superintendent of Police C.M. Pradeepkumar about the involvement of terrorists in the Marad killings. </p><p class="body">Addressing a news conference here on Saturday he said that the Chief Minister had asked Mr. Pradeepkumar to soft-pedal the probe on issues such as the telephone calls between Mohammed Fahad, a suspected member of the Pakistan-based Al-BadrÂ terrorÂ group, and a youth leader of the ruling Congress-led United Democratic Front. </p><p class="body">Mr. Pradeepkumar had for some time led the investigation into the involvement of external agencies and Muslim fundamentalists in the killing of nine persons at the seaside village on May 2, 2003. The probe was ordered by the State government after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) refused to investigate the case based on the recommendations of the Thomas P. Joseph Commission. The Commission had recommended probing the larger conspiracy in the planning and execution of the Marad killings.</p><p class="body">Mr. Muraleedharan said that the Chief Minister should clarify on these allegations made by Mr. Pradeepkumar at a function organised by the Hindu Aikya Vedi in the city on the anniversary of the killings. He said that the BJP had earlier raised the same allegation. </p><p class="body">Now the investigation into the larger conspiracy had been stalled. The Congress party which was ruling the State with the support of the Indian Union Muslim League had shielded the terrorists. A CBI inquiry into the killings had been sabotaged on this account, Mr. Muraleedharan alleged. </p><p class="body">Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president V.M. Sudheeran should also explain whether his party encouraged terror activities, he said.</p><p class="body">Mr. Muraleedharan said that people of the State had the right to know what happened to the investigation by a special police team into the larger conspiracy behind the incident, financial sources, and national and international connections and their ramifications.Â </p><hr><h1>Boat crushed by waves, crew escape</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 14:51 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">Ajith was in a state of shock and could not speak for a long time. He could not believe that he had escaped unscathed though the boat he was fishing in was shattered. </p><p class="body">Ajith, 42, along with Anandan, 40, and Hameed, 40, had gone fishing at around 2 a.m. on Saturday on Ajith&#8217;s boat from Puthiyappa. They were on their way back around 8.15 a.m. when a strong wave destroyed the boat. However, the boat, along with the three fishermen, was washed ashore by another wave. </p><p class="body">For Ajith&#8217;s family, the boat was their only means of income. He had bought the boat two years ago for Rs.5 lakh, and had been earning a fair profit since then. He was banking on the boat for his children&#8217;s education as well as to build a house. His children, Indrajith and Sreelakshmi, are in classes 5 and 4 respectively. The family lives in a shed since their house is being constructed. </p><p class="body">The boat was not insured and fisheries officials who visited the site refused to comment.

The government had made all efforts to clear various hurdles, including the vexed issue of land acquisition, aimed at the smooth and timely completion of the Metro Rail project, he said. </p><p class="body"> Mr. Eden said the government had already sanctioned Rs. 25 crore for the widening of the Thammanam-Pullepady Raod but the corporation could not ensure the time-bound completion of the project that would have eased the traffic snarls in the city. He said the government had also sanctioned Rs. 19 crore for developing 22 roads under the Kochi Corporation. </p><p class="body"> The MLA urged the Kochi Corporation authorities to step up pressure on the State government and relevant agencies to increase funding for various road projects rather than complaining over the lack of support from the State government for city's development. </p><p class="body"> Mr. Eden said a meeting of elected representatives would be held at Thiruvananthapuram on May 7 to resolve various issues related to the Kochi Metro Rail. He praised the Kochi Metro Rail Ltd for trying its best to ensure the timely completion of the project. </p><p class="body"> Referring to the differences between the Mayor and the Chairman of the Greater Cochin Development Authority over the laser show project at Rajendra Maidan, Mr. Eden said it was a viable initiative that should be supported. He requested the local body to speed up necessary clearances for the project. </p><hr><h1>Fresh estimates for Kochi Town Hall renovation</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 14:42 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">The Corporation of Cochin will make fresh estimates for the renovation of the Ernakulam Town Hall, pending for about a year now after it was found that the structure required more extensive intervention than planned earlier.</p><p class="body">Corporation Council&#8217;s Town Planning Standing Committee Chairman K. J. Sohan said the project for renovation of the city&#8217;s two town halls &#8212; the other one being in Mattancherry, was included in decentralised plan last year with a total estimated expenditure of Rs.2 crore.</p><p class="body">The town hall renovation projects were taken up as multi-year projects to ensure that the works, even if expensive, were carried out in full considering the importance of these public amenities. The initial plan was to allot Rs.50 lakh each over two years for the two town halls within the corporation limits. However, on examination of the structure of the Ernakulam Town Hall it was found that the structure needed elaborate repair as it had been built in the old style. Leaks and damage to the walls were extensive, he said, pointing out the reason behind not commencing the work.</p><p class="body">A structural engineering expert from the Cochin University of Science and Technology had been entrusted with the task of studying the Town Hall building. The report has already been received. However, the corporation was now planning to make fresh estimates for the repairs based on the structural engineering report, Mr. Sohan added.</p><p class="body">Meanwhile, work on the Mattancherry Town Hall, the structure of which was found strong, was nearing completion now.</p><p class="body">Mr. Sohan said the corporation authority had ceded eight cents for the Kochi Metro Rail project squeezing the already constricted parking space within the Ernakulam Town Hall premises. He said the corporation had ceded a total of about 10 cents adjacent to the Town Hall.</p><p class="body">The Town Hall is a busy spot with exhibitions and conventions being frequently held there. The corporation authorities are hard-pressed to find proper parking facility even as they look to the possibility of also improving access to the Town Hall.</p><hr><h1>ETS to no longer provide TOEFL, TOEIC tests for UK visa</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 14:13 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Dealing a blow to many visa aspirants especially students, British authorities have said global testing giant ETS will no longer offer TOEFL and TOEIC tests for U.K. visa-granting purposes, in the wake of a recent controversy.</p><p class="body">Following allegations in a <i>BBC</i> programme in February this year that fraudulent measures were adopted by candidates to obtain Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) accreditation, the British Home Office has announced that its contract with the global testing giant &#8212; Education Testing Service (ETS) &#8212; will not be extended.</p><p class="body">As per the U.K. Council for International Student Affairs&#8217; official website, &#8220;ETS is no longer providing TOEIC and TOEFL tests for people who want to use them in support of U.K. immigration applications.

The response of the local bodies to the situation was enough indication of how things were &#8211; with less than 50 of 73 panchayats submitting projects within the deadline &#8211; and how things could be this year since the ground situation that &#8220;inspired&#8221; the projects has hardly changed. </p><p class="body">Last year, there were more defunct hand pumps in the district than working ones &#8211; a situation that is more or less the same this year as well; a majority of its public open wells and ponds were polluted, again something that is yet to change; and more disturbingly, little was done to address these despite the situation being the same for several years. </p><p class="body">According to District Collector Biju Prabhakar, the administration had arranged for enough water tankers to cater to needy areas this year and the decision was that local bodies would not be allowed to use drought relief funds as per their whims and fancies, but only for making provisions for drinking water.</p><p class="body">&#8220;It is not when the drought is at your doorstep that you think of water supply schemes and projects that can be taken up much earlier. There are instances from last year, when Rs.32 lakh was spent on a water supply scheme, with water yet to reach that place. We won&#8217;t allow that this year, with the funds to be given only for drinking water supply,&#8221; he told <i>The Hindu</i>, adding that an audit of what was done last year would be done with efforts on to collect data on last year&#8217;s project implementation. </p><p class="body">Reports suggest that almost all panchayats in the district are in for a tough summer, something that could have been avoided with a little bit of foresight, since it is not water that is absent, but the ways and the will to distribute it efficiently. Project reports submitted last year revealed that panchayats like Vellarada, which had 37 hand pumps, had only five of them operational. In Amboori, just three out of 36 were working while in Vilappilsala, only seven of 25 were functional. </p><p class="body">The condition of ponds in every panchayat was pathetic, and remains to be so. Chirayinkeezhu had reported 78 polluted ponds, while Kuttichal had 50 polluted ponds and Kilimanoor 46 ponds that were polluted beyond use. Panavoor had 46 while Vellanadu panchayat had 71 polluted ponds. While some measures were initiated to revive a few of these, the larger picture remains the same, a district panchayat official said. </p><p class="body">The condition of overhead water tanks was stated to be satisfactory in most panchayats, but the condition of water pipelines was replete with complaints. According to Mr. Prabhakar, the government and the district administration have decided not to allow repair works of the KWA to be done with drought funds. &#8220;Those are works that should be taken up and completed much before the drought. So we will not be allowing drought funds for such works wherever possible,&#8221; he said.</p><hr><h1>Life in Kashmir Valley returns to normal after three days of curfew</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 13:36 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Life in Kashmir Valley returned to normal on Sunday after three days of curfew and strike following the killing of a youth in alleged security forces&#8217; firing in Nawa kadal area of the city.</p><p class="body">Shops and business establishments opened in the city in Srinagar and other parts of the Valley, while transport services also resumed plying on all routes.</p><p class="body">The weekly flea market in the heart of the city here was abuzz with the activity.</p><p class="body">Authorities had imposed curfew in the interior areas of the city following the killing of the youth Bashir Ahmad Bhat on Wednesday when security forces allegedly opened fire to chase away stone-pelting protesters.</p><p class="body">The protests erupted in Nawa Kadal area in interior of the city when security forces were being withdrawn after poll duty.</p><p class="body">While separatist groups had called for a strike for only one day on Thursday, people all over the Valley observed a spontaneous shutdown for two days on Friday and Saturday.</p><hr><h1>RSS following in the footsteps of Hitler: VS</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 13:31 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activists in Kerala are following in the footsteps of Adolf Hitler to kill activists of the Democratic Youth Federation of India, the Students Federation of India, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan has said. </p><p class="body">&#8220;The murderous face of the RSS was seen by the country during the Gujarat riots of 2002 and the demolition of the Babri Masjid,&#8221; he said while inaugurating a dharna organised by the DYFI at the Press Club Maidan here on Saturday to protest against the murder of DYFI leader Sreeraj, allegedly by RSS activists, at Nedumankavu last month.</p><p class="body">Mr. Achuthanandan said that neither the Congress not the United Democratic Front government was doing anything to counter the &#8220;reign of terror being unleashed by the RSS.&#8221; The government seemed to be promoting such activities, he said. Hence the police were lax in properly investigating murder cases in which RSS activists were involved. </p><p class="body">He said that the RSS had murdered hundreds of CPI(M) and other Left activists in the State since the 1970s.

In this connection an expert team comprising veterinarians, wildlife experts and forest officials will diagnose the condition of the elephant on Sunday.</p><p class="body">The High Court intervened in the issue following a petition from Daya, an NGO. The animal is being tended to on daily basis by Forest Department officials attached to the Idamalayar Forest Range office. The elephant which is unable to forage is being fed with fruits and palm fronds which it readily accepts from the forest officials.</p><p class="body">Chief Wildlife Warden, G. Harikumar, told <i>The Hindu</i> that preliminary diagnosis of the elephant showed that it has a serious injury in its left foreleg. The leg is badly swollen and it is limping heavily. He said that it is not clear why the elephant chose to take refuge in the waters of the reservoir. </p><p class="body">But the animal keeps standing in the water most of the time and occasionally comes out of it for short breaks. Mr. Harikumar said that the health condition of the animal has appreciably improved compared to the condition in which it was first found. It has now got used to the forest officials who arrive there regularly to provide food. </p><p class="body">The officials have to travel more than one km in a boat from the dam site to reach the location where the elephant stands. Initially on prescription from a veterinary official, some oral medication was administered by concealing it in pineapples given as food to the elephant. </p><p class="body">But it was later withdrawn since it was suspected that the animal was allergic to the medicines. </p><p class="body">Animal rescue experts said that the elephant standing continuously in water can create other health problems. But rescuing and relocating the elephant from the site where it presently stands will be a herculean task. </p><p class="body">The location is such that it will be difficult to bring in cranes or other such equipment. But the Forest Department is doing its best to ensure the well-being of the injured animal, Mr. Harikumar said. </p><p class="body">The course of action to be taken will be based on the report to be submitted by the expert committee after its visit on Sunday, he said. </p><p class="body">It was Adivasis of the area who first found the elephant in the reservoir. </p><p class="body">On noticing that it was injured, they informed the Edamalayar Range Forest officials about it. Adivasis told <i>The Hindu</i> that as they did not see any external injuries, they suspect dislocation or fracture of the affected forelimb.</p><hr><h1>Big recruitments in banks to continue</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 13:27 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Recruitments in the banking sector that have been big in recent years, generating considerable interest among job-seekers, are set to remain so for the next few years as well. This, however, does not make it any easy for the aspirants as with bank jobs gaining currency, the competition is also hotting up. </p><p class="body"> Indeed, it is intense as the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS), which conducts recruitment examination on behalf of public sector banks, says the number of applications received has been a whopping 1 crore a year for the last two years. The number of posts was 50,000 on an average a year. The break-up, sources associated with the recruitment process say, is 20,000 officers and 30,000 clerical cadre posts. </p><p class="body"> It is in this backdrop a Bangalore-based firm, with which many past and present bankers are associated, recently introduced an e-learning programme to train the candidates. Unveiling the course and website of BReT Solutions Private Ltd., Canara Bank chairman and managing director R.K. Dubey underscored the significance of better preparation for the candidates. </p><p class="body"> Other speakers, including non-executive chairman of Karnataka Bank Ananthakrishna, said with the examinations being conducted online, the candidates need to tune themselves from that perspective too. </p><p class="body"> Canara Bank recruitment this fiscal, Mr. Dubey said, was likely to exceed last year&#8217;s 7,800. State Bank of India was planning an online exam around June for selecting 1,897 probationary officers. A key reason for the massive recruitment in the banking sector is the growing emphasis on financial inclusion &#8212; spreading to unbanked areas. With many employees who joined in 1970s retiring, more posts are falling vacant. </p><p class="body"> <b>Popular choice</b> </p><p class="body"> A senior banker, who did not want to be identified, attributed the popularity of bank jobs to the reasonable salaries, job security, improved status in society and the opportunity to serve customers. Recruitment by public sector banks was 50,000 for the past two years. The same pattern would continue for three more years, he added. </p><p class="body"> In terms of applications, there seems to be more from Bihar and States where job opportunities were relatively less compared with States where employment was available in manufacturing and services sectors. On the level of competition, the senior banker said the date of birth was the decider when hundreds of candidates were tied at the same score. Seniority in age gets them the job. </p><p class="body"> On the competition, a senior executive of BReT Solutions said that according to IBPS figures only 10 per cent of the estimated 2 crore candidates who took the examination got selected for interview. Of them, a mere 2.3 per cent got the final selection notice. </p><p class="body"> Chairman and managing director of BReT Solutions Ashok Hegde, a former general manager of Karnataka Bank, said in the absence of proper training, clearing the examinations was not easy. </p><hr><h1>Coastal tourism to get a boost</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 13:20 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Several beaches in Karnataka are set to get a facelift with the Union government approving Rs. 45-crore phase one of a project to develop tourism in &#8216;Coastal Karnataka Tourism Circuit&#8217;. </p><p class="body"> This is one of the four circuits identified in Karnataka for tourism development. </p><p class="body"> In Dakshina Kannada district, beaches at Uchila, Someshwar, Ullal, Tannirbavi, Panambur and Surathkal are likely to be taken up for development apart from some islands. They will get facilities such as approach roads, toilets, and watchtowers, according to sources in the Tourism Department. </p><p class="body"> While Director of Karnataka Tourism G. Satyavathi confirmed that the Centre has approved the Rs. 45-crore project, official sources said this was only the first instalment of the bigger project envisaging expenditure of about Rs. 500 crore to develop more than 140 beaches. In the next three years, about Rs. 150 crore is expected to be spent, with bulk of it coming from the Union government. </p><p class="body"> Though the plan was to provide cottages along the beeches, there is no government land outside the Coastal Regulation Zone (200 m away from the high tide line) in Dakshina Kannada. The department, however, hopes to encourage private players to build cottages for tourists. </p><p class="body"> <b>Four circuits identified</b><br/> <br/> A study conducted by Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services Ltd. for the government of India&#8217;s Tourism Department has identified four circuits for development in Karnataka. One of them, the Coastal Karnataka Tourism Circuit, comprises destinations in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada districts along the coastline extending up to Goa. </p><p class="body"> The study said, &#8220;Based on the carrying capacity assessment, tourism potential, and discussion with the Department of Tourism, Karnataka, the Circuit 1 (coastal tourism) &#8230; has been proposed as the priority circuit.&#8221; It listed Mangalore&#8217;s good connectivity with domestic and international destinations via air, rail and road network as a key advantage. It said tourism destinations in the three districts have good connectivity with Mangalore, with NHAI having taken up the project to upgrade the national highway from Talapady to Kundapur into a four-lane road. </p><p class="body"> <b>Key positives</b> </p><p class="body"> Significant tourist inflows, diversity and quality of tourism assets in terms of beaches, scenic destinations, backwaters, wildlife sanctuaries and adventure tourism, and historical monuments were other key positives for the circuit. </p><p class="body"> The poor state of approach roads, and lack of drinking water facility, parking, food and beverages outlets, quality wayside amenities and public conveniences on the way to some of the tourism destinations were mentioned as weaknesses. </p><p class="body"> But the coastline circuit had significant potential for development of beach tourism, &#8220;given that Karnataka shares the same coastline with Goa and Kerala&#8221;, the study concluded. </p><hr><h1>Delhi Metro to construct underpass </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 13:14 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has now been asked by the Delhi Government&#8217;s Public Works Department to construct an underpass for traffic on Benito Juarez Marg that will enable a right turn towards Ring Road and also towards San Martin Marg on the other side of Ring Road. </p><p class="body">&#8220;The design is being worked out. Since the Delhi Metro has already constructed overground and laid the foundation, we will ask them to construct the underpass as well,&#8221; said a senior PWD official. </p><p class="body">The tendering for the project will commence after May 16 when the model code of conduct will no longer be in force.</p><p class="body">The underpass will cross the entire stretch of the road with two ramps on both sides, said the official, one leading towards Jesus &amp; Mary College and one towards the Ring Road. The proposal for the underpass was put forward to decongest the Rao Tula Ram Marg and Dhaula Kuan and to fully utilise the Benito Juarez Marg for traffic coming from the airport and National Highway-8. So far a right turn was not provided to go towards Moti Bagh and New Delhi.</p><p class="body">The proposal for the underpass has been previously screened and passed by both the Unified Traffic and Transportation (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) and the Delhi Urban Arts Commission. The last governing body of the UTTIPEC also saw representatives from the PWD, the Traffic Police and the Delhi Metro participate. </p><p class="body">The proposed underpass is part of a long term measure to improve traffic flow on RTR Marg that also includes construction of a three-lane flyover parallel to the RTR flyover that will extend the existing Munirka flyover by a kilometre. </p><p class="body">In March this year, the Delhi Government had granted the sanction for the project.</p><hr><h1>Baby boom at Delhi zoo</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 13:05 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> The sprawling Delhi zoo, spread over 176-acre with over 130 species of animals and birds from around the world, has brought good tidings. </p><p class="body">The zoo has, for the first time, witnessed the birth of two fox pups, which, according to the authorities, are doing well.</p><p class="body">The latest additions came early this week. They were born to a vixen brought from Bilaspur zoo about five months ago.</p><p class="body">National Zoological Park veterinary officer N. Panneer Selvam said: &#8220;It is a great achievement for Delhi zoo because foxes are tough animals to breed in captivity. They have to be provided just the right environment and a comfortable spot to keep their pups.&#8221;</p><p class="body">&#8220;We are treating this as an unexpected bonus for our hard work. The pups have not come out of the burrow so far, but we expect them to make an appearance within the next 10 days or so. The zoo now has two foxes and a vixen [which just gave birth]. We finally have a robust fox population,&#8221; he added.</p><p class="body">The good news, however, does not stop here. Earlier this week, the zoo also witnessed the birth of three jackal pups. </p><p class="body">&#8220;We have as many as eight to nine jackals, which is another good indicator of the environment offered to the animals at the zoo,&#8217;&#8217; said Dr. Selvam.</p><p class="body">The mountain goat too gave birth to three kids. &#8220;We have examined the kids and they are doing well. The officials are monitoring their health closely. We are keeping a close watch on a hyena, which might give birth. However, a confirmation will be offered only after a full health check-up of the animal,&#8221; Dr. Selvam added.</p><hr><h1>Pop goes the shopaholic</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 13:02 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> What should Delhiites do when they&#8217;re in the market for handcrafted Balinese furniture or an American shoe brand not available in the country? They just wait for them to pop-up. </p><p class="body">Over the last two years, the concept of pop-ups &#8212; temporary retail spaces specialising in one product or brand, have slowly become popular with both customers and businesses in the Capital. A pop-up, or flash retail, usually lasts from one day to three months to either offer a unique product or range or test the market.</p><p class="body">Pop-up shops are an alternative for those who still want the physical experience of shopping for products that are usually only available online or not available in India at all. Everything from restaurants offering authentic French cuisine for a night to an affordable range of saris have popped up in the city over the past year. </p><p class="body">According to retailers, the finite nature of a pop-up means people turn up just so they don&#8217;t miss the chance.</p><p class="body"> On Friday, a pop-up sale hosted at a store in South Delhi&#8217;s Hauz Khas Village brought together jewellery made with Brazilian gemstones, one-of-a-kind leather bags and upcycled silk capes made in Gujarat. </p><p class="body">&#8220;Pop-ups are the way to go today,&#8221; says Pooja Duggal, who held the sale in her shoe store Fathom Customs. </p><p class="body">With her tiny shop buzzing with activity, Ms. Duggal says her first pop-up event was a success as it offered something different. She played the perfect host by offering customers refreshments, the point being to create a friendly atmosphere for an otherwise cold, commercial transaction. </p><p class="body">&#8220;The designers and NGOs we have here for the pop-up sale are all working with a concept, but don&#8217;t have any retail space in Delhi. It&#8217;s a unique experience for customers as they won&#8217;t find these products in a mall or anywhere else,&#8221; she says. </p><p class="body">Pop-ups are not only about unique products but about reaching people whom traditional retailers cannot. Punit Jasuja, who runs Second Floor Studio, an interior design store in Khan Market and Shahpur Jat, was approached by male customers who said there was no dedicated space for their wardrobe needs. </p><p class="body">&#8220;Pop-ups are about getting to an audience that we normally can&#8217;t. Marketing says that you need to see a brand four or five times before you buy it, so pop-ups are a good way to test the market,&#8221; says Punit. </p><p class="body">Filling a gap in the market, Punit did a men&#8217;s pop-up in Khan Market in March. Lindsey Sebastyn, who works in business development for Second Floor Studio, says: &#8220;It was so successful that we extended it past the original one-month period. For customers it is about having a different or cool experience, and for us it is a way to engage with our clientele.&#8221; </p><p class="body">At CMYK, a bookstore in Mehar Chand Market, there have been 15 pop-ups in the last six months. Rajni Chugh, retail head of Roli Books that runs CMYK, says: &#8220;We have had a very successful experience with the pop-ups. It is not just about luxury brands, products have to be affordable too.&#8221; </p><p class="body">While summer is a lean season for pop-ups, this marketing gimmick-cum-shopping experience is not going to pop away anytime soon. </p><hr><h1>Left wonâ€™t have strong presence in next Lok Sabha, admits Karat</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 13:37 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Prakash Karat conceded on Saturday that the Left would not have a strong presence in the next Lok Sabha to influence policy even if a third alternative government was formed with Congress support.</p><p class="body">He was responding to reports suggesting that the Congress was wary of doing business with the Left for fear that the CPI(M) will try to steer the country away from economic liberalisation. </p><p class="body">Fielding questions on a range of issues during an interaction with the media, Mr. Karat refused to be drawn into speculation on whether the CPI(M) would be open to having the Trinamool Congress in the third alternative if required. &#8220;We will have to wait and see because it is a party which has earlier had no hesitation to go with the BJP. Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee&#8217;s attitude to [BJP prime ministerial candidate] Narendra Modi will become clear only after the elections,&#8221; he said, dismissing her anti-BJP statements as poll rhetoric. &#8220;It is very possible that she will join the NDA now and leave just before the West Bengal Assembly elections to get the Muslim vote.&#8221; </p><p class="body">Maintaining that the widespread anti-Congress sentiment was being misinterpreted as a &#8220;Modi wave,&#8221; Mr. Karat insisted that the BJP alone would not benefit from this mood; even non-Congress secular parties stood to gain. </p><p class="body">On the potential constituents of the third alternative, Mr. Karat pointed out that not one of the 11 signatories to the February 25 statement had gone with the Congress or the BJP. He also indicated the possibility of a couple of other parties joining this alternative, underscoring that the Congress would have to be integral to such a grouping.</p><p class="body">About the stability of a third alternative, given past experience, the CPI(M) leader maintained that it was not the smaller parties but the Congress which destabilised two United Front governments.</p><p class="body">About the Samajwadi Party&#8217;s alleged communal campaign, he said many of the statements attributed to the party were essentially made to counter the RSS propaganda that has been gathering steam ever since the Akhilesh Yadav government came to power in Uttar Pradesh. </p><hr><h1>Assam violence: Locals in Baksa refuse to bury the dead till Gogoiâ€™s visit</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 12:09 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Demanding that Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi visit their area, people of Salbari in Assam&#8217;s violence-hit Baksa district on Sunday refused to bury their kin killed in attacks by NDFB-Songbijit militants. </p><p class="body"> Angry protestors in Nankekhadrabari area on Sunday said they will not perform the last rites of the bodies of the 18 people, including children and women, till Mr. Gogoi comes and personally assures to provide security to their lives and property. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Does our life have no value?

You will miss me when I am gone. It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> Russian President Vladimir Putin too was at the receiving end of Mr. Obama&#8217;s wit, notwithstanding the Ukraine crisis. He cracked jokes about Mr. Putin being headed for a Nobel Peace Prize. &#8220;To be fair, they give those to just about anybody these days,&#8221; said Mr. Obama, a laureate himself. </p><p class="body"> He also turned the humour on Republican party saying the opposition brought in experts to learn how to talk to women. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Both sides are doing whatever it takes to win - a ruthless game. Republicans, this is a true story. Republicans actually brought in a group of consultants to teach their candidates how to speak to women. This is true. And I don&#8217;t know if it will work with women, but I understand that America&#8217;s teenage boys are signing up to run for the Senate in droves.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> The President, who has completed nearly half of his second innings at the White House, also joked about opposition being busy attempting to repeal &#8220;Obamacare&#8221;. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Of course, there is one thing that keeps Republicans busy. They have tried more than 50 times to repeal Obamacare. </p><p class="body"> Despite that, 8 million people signed up for health care in the first open enrollment which does lead one to ask, how well does Obamacare have to work before you don&#8217;t want to repeal it?&#8221; he said. </p><p class="body"> Mr. Obama recalled his days in office and the difficulties he faced last year and also mentioned the presidential election in 2016. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;It is strange to think that I have just two-and-a-half years left in this office. Everywhere I look, there are reminders that I only hold this job temporarily. But it is a long time between now and 2016, and anything can happen. You may have heard the other day Hillary had to dodge a flying shoe at a press conference,&#8221; Mr. Obama said as the slide showed Biden holding a shoe. &#8220;I love that picture.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> The dinner at the Washington Hilton Hotel has often come at key moments in the U.S. President&#8217;s presidency.

Ltd. is one of the large defaulters of the scam with initial liability of Rs. 922 crore and according to latest data it owes Rs. 600.08 crore, of which it has paid Rs. 52.85 crore to the exchange. </p><p class="body"> The ED probe found that while Mohan India group of companies had &#8220;received funds in their settlement accounts from NSEL purportedly on account of sale of sugar..., they were eventually transferred to various individuals and entities and payments were made to car dealers, developers, construction firms etc by way of transfers, NEFT/RTGS payments/pay orders.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> The agency, in a voluminous report, has furnished the documentary proof of the movement of all this money sourced from NSEL to the end purchase of real estate or cars by tracking bank transactions spread across various parts of the country. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;Investigations under the PMLA have revealed that the defendants (Mohan India Pvt Ltd and others) were dealing in sale and re-purchase of sugar without having any physical stock of sugar. They had received funds from NSEL on account of sale of sugar which they have not delivered to NSEL at all. </p><p class="body"> There was no question of NSEL allowing them to invest these funds in real estate,&#8221; the probe report said. </p><p class="body"> The agency has also recorded a number of statements of the officials of the NSEL and Mohan India Pvt. Ltd. under PMLA before preparing and submitting the first investigation report in this case to the court. </p><p class="body"> The ED said it attached luxury vehicles like a Toyota Fortuner, three Range Rovers, flats in Gomti Enclave in Lucknow, eight plots of land in Karnal in Haryana, a posh flat in Mumbai&#8217;s Borivali, plots in costly addresses like Mehrauli, Hauz Khas, Jor Bagh and Sainik Farms in Delhi and other such assets as &#8220;there was a likelihood of immediate sale or disposal of such high-end vehicles and luxurious properties (by the firm in question) and the non-attachment of the same would have frustrated the proceedings under the Act (PMLA).&#8221; </p><p class="body"> &#8220;It was revealed that funds obtained from NSEL were diverted for the purposes other than the purpose for which they were obtained raising the suspicion that the said amounts were laundered by MS Mohan India group,&#8221; the ED said in its report. </p><p class="body"> The agency has also relied on a report of the I-T department against the firm that said that the &#8220;godowns which were declared to NSEL (by the firm) as designated warehouse had no capacity to store the quantity of sugar traded by them (Mohan India and others) on the NSEL platform.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> The ED has said that its probe in this case is &#8220;still in infancy at this stage&#8221; and further investigation is on. </p><p class="body"> The Rs. 5,600-crore payment crisis at NSEL and the alleged scam is being probed by different agencies like the Mumbai Economic Offences Wing and the Income Tax department. </p><hr><h1>Lily â€“ the new kid in the block </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 10:51 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> One-and-half-year old &#8216;Lily&#8217; is the new entrant to the City Police Detective Dog Squad. </p><p class="body">Having undergone six months training in detecting explosive substances, &#8216;Lily&#8217; has been inducted into active service.</p><p class="body">The female detective dog, belonging to the Labrador Retriever breed, was put into anti-sabotage missions on several occasions in the last one month after its induction.

He says they have developed tools using bamboo and wood to chase animals back into the forest before they raid agricultural crops. They use &#8216;stone bow&#8217; &#8212; a bamboo bow with two strings &#8212; using which they shoot stones instead of an arrow to chase animals such as monkeys, langurs, squirrels and birds that may destroy their crops. </p><p class="body"> They also use &#8216;Kulikkai,&#8217; made of bamboo. It is two-feet long. A wooden stick is kept in place in the middle cross-wise using a rope. When the tool is moved left and right, the wooden piece in the middle strikes on the hollow bamboo and creates noise. On hearing this noise, animals get scared and leave the fields. </p><p class="body"> Another tool of the Kani tribe is &#8216;adi-udukkai.&#8217; It is made from a two-feet-long bamboo piece. A slit is made in the bamboo for half an inch where the slit portion remains as a separate piece, but remains attached to the major piece at one end. When the bamboo is shaken upwards and downwards, the slit portion strikes at the major piece, the vibration of which creates noise to scare away animals from their fields. This tool is used during daytime to scare away squirrels, monkeys, and birds. At night, it is used to drive away wild boars and small nocturnal animals. </p><p class="body"> Chathan Kani of Velampi kani tribe settlement says four to five feet deep trenches are dug to prevent elephants from entering agricultural fields. Because of its large size, an elephant cannot step down into a narrow and deep trench and come out of it, he says. </p><hr><h1>Pakistan violates ceasefire, opens unprovoked firing</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 10:50 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Pakistani troops violated ceasefire and resorted to unprovoked firing on the Line of Control (LoC) in Mendhar sector of Poonch district in Jammu and Kashmir, an official said on Sunday. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;The Pakistani troops violated the bilateral ceasefire resorting to unprovoked firing at our positions on the LoC in Mendhar sector.

Vaideeswaram, president, Erode District Mango Growers' Association. Alphonso, Bangalora and Imam Pasand varieties are mostly grown in Erode district.</p><p class="body">Mangoes have started arriving in large quantities from Salem and other parts of the State to the markets in Erode. Though the mango season has begun, it will take a month more for fruit-cutting to begin in the district.</p><p class="body">Due to the low productivity, there is no compulsion for the growers in the district to ripen mangoes in bulk by artificial means, Mr.</p><p class="body">Vaideeswaram said. The stocks kept in the market come under periodic scrutiny of the Food Safety department. Mangoes ripened with calcium carbide stones are confiscated.</p><p class="body">Farmers say artificial ripening of fruits is not unusual the world over. For, ripe fruits cannot be transported. The raw fruits, after harvest, are first transported and then ripened at places close to consumption. But, ripening of the fruit with calcium carbide, a chemical material made of limestone, is illegal in India due to health risks, reflecting in vomiting, diarrhea, and burning sensation. The Food Safety Department, sources said, confiscates mango stocks if it is found that only the outer skin of the fruit has ripened while the flesh remains firm and more fibrous. Such fruits, the sources said, are more acidic and have shorter shelf life. "In Erode district, growers use doses of ethylene to induce ripening. This method of ripening is legal," Mr. Vaideeswaram said.</p><hr><h1>Three killed in twin explosions in Kenya</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 10:47 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Three people were killed and scores hurt on Saturday when two explosions rocked the Indian Ocean port city of Mombasa, Kenya&#8217;s Interior Ministry said.</p><p class="body">All the casualties occurred when a grenade was thrown into a crowd at a bus stop in central Mombasa about 8:15 p.m. (1700 GMT), Mombasa police chief Robert Kitur told <i>dpa</i> by phone.

The dam, however, has not reached its full capacity in the last nine decades owing to various reasons, including scanty rainfall in the region. </p><p class="body">Presently, the water-level in the dam is about 68.5 ft against the full reservoir level of 145 ft, and the dead storage level is 60 ft. <b>Silt accumulation</b>There is a considerable decrease in the storage capacity of the dam owing to silt accumulation. No steps have been taken to remove silt from the dam since its construction, sources said. The water available in the dam can be supplied for another two months, sources said. Apart from Chitradurga city and Hiriyur taluk, water has to also be supplied to premier institutes such as ISRO, DRDO and India Reserve Battalion as per agreements signed with them. </p><p class="body">The authorities have also granted permission for the construction of barrages at some places across the Vedavati in Kallod and check-dams at certain places, which would further reduce the flow of water to the dam.

But once there, you see a site, dating back to 8 B.C. to 6 B.C, and protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) since 1951, thoroughly vandalised. </p><p class="body">The area, better known for supplying granite blocks to Bangalore, is part of an ancient civilisation that existed in the Arkavati basin. </p><p class="body">A majority of the subterranean rectangular burial chambers (cists) and Cairn Circle in a eucalyptus grove on a hillock, spread across 6.5 acres of government land, have fallen prey to treasure hunters, while several others have been damaged from quarrying. Pottery and iron fragments of that period are still seen scattered in the opened cists. </p><p class="body">The ASI has dashed off letters to the Department of Mines and Geology and the Department of Kannada and Culture to prohibit quarrying and protect the few burial chambers that remain. It has also sent its field officers to assess the damage and take steps to prevent further ruin.</p><p class="body">&#8220;The destruction of the burial site has been taking place systematically over the years, and now almost all the 50 graves have been vandalised,&#8221; said a village resident of Chapparkallu. Quarrying has been under way for over a decade now, he added. &#8220;After the ASI realised that the site was being vandalised, they put up boards stating it is protected. But, it hasn&#8217;t helped much,&#8221; he said, adding that most of the chambers were prised opened in the last five years. </p><p class="body">What is even more shocking is that a road has been laid over some burial chambers to enable heavy vehicles to pass through. Meanwhile, an ASI source said: &#8220;Some of the burial chambers were vandalised even before it came under ASI protection. The geomorphology of the site, that had remained intact for centuries, started changing suddenly due to urbanisation. However, the site will be fenced to prevent further damage.&#8221; </p><hr><h1>$1500 Google Glass actually a $80 device?</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 06:21 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">Looking forward to spend $1,500 (Rs.90,000) to buy your set of Google Glass soon?

Â </p><p class="body">Also, be it the State&#8217;s Own Revenue (tax and non-tax) or in respect of select indicators like the development expenditure-GSDP ratio or the social sector expenditure-GSDP ratio, Tamil Nadu&#8217;s performance surpassed Gujarat&#8217;s.</p><p class="body">The RBI report, an annual publication, presents an exhaustive account of the fiscal position of all State governments.</p><p class="body">However, the story on public finances is not one-sided, and there are areas wherein Gujarat has scored over Tamil Nadu. For example, the former had a higher revenue surplus for 2011-2012. Compared with Tamil Nadu&#8217;s revenue surplus of around Rs. 13.6 billion, Gujarat registered Rs. 32 billion. Â In respect of the fiscal deficit-GSDP ratio, Gujarat&#8217;s score was 1.8 per cent against Tamil Nadu&#8217;s 2.6 per cent. As for the profit/loss of public sector undertakings, the accumulated losses of the Tamil Nadu PSUs stood at Rs. 596 billion, whereas Gujarat&#8217;s undertakings (many of which are in the sector of energy and petroleum) recorded Rs. 16.9 billion in profits.Â Â </p><p class="body">Â On the relative positive features of Tamil Nadu, the value of the State&#8217;s Own Revenue was Rs. 652 billion, while it was Rs. 495 billion for Gujarat. Tamil Nadu overtook Gujarat even in the parameter of the SOR as a ratio to the GSDP. Tamil Nadu&#8217;s 11.2 per cent was about three percentage points ahead of Gujarat&#8217;s (8.09 per cent). Â (TheÂ total value of the GSDP of the two StatesÂ is sourced from the budgetary documents of the States). Â </p><p class="body">With regard to the relationship between interest payments and revenue receipts, Tamil Nadu&#8217;s ratio (10.4 per cent) was lower than that of Gujarat (17.4 per cent). This means that the annual interest outgo on loans is lesser for Tamil Nadu than for Gujarat for 2011-12. Yet, the western State&#8217;s higher revenue surplus could be attributed to its less expenditure on wages and salaries and in the social sector, in both of which Tamil Nadu spent cumulatively about Rs. 210 billion more than Gujarat&#8217;s Rs.478 billion.Â  As for outstanding liabilities, Tamil Nadu&#8217;s tally was lower than Gujarat&#8217;s by Rs. 200 billion. In terms of percentage of the GSDP, the liabilities of the southern State accounted for 19.6 per cent, while Gujarat&#8217;s debtÂ amounted toÂ 24.7 per cent ofÂ its GSDP. </p><hr><h1>Pranab sees films as moral anchors</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 02:28 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Reminding creative people of the Indian film industry that they need to use their artistic pursuits to create socially relevant cinema, President Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday said filmmakers should deploy their creative efforts to propagate core values such as patriotism, respect for women, compassion and tolerance. </p><p class="body"> Conferring film awards in various categories at the 61st National Film Awards at Vigyan Bhawan here, Mr. Mukherjee said the cinematic content of films should have a desirable impact on the social behaviour of people, especially the new generation. &#8220;Faced with erosion of values in today&#8217;s context, cinema should play a catalytic role in resetting our moral compass.&#8221; </p><p class="body"> The highlight of the function was when the compere announced the name of noted poet Gulzar for the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award for his lifelong contribution to cinema.

As soon as he landed, his trainers ran out and huddled around him. Amid cheers, one said, &#8220;We did it. You made history.&#8221;</p><p class="body"> Divyanshu Ganatra had just become the only visually-challenged Indian paraglider to have flown solo. &#8220;It was a spiritual high,&#8221; Mr. Ganatra told <i>The Hindu</i> before adding modestly: &#8220;I did it like everyone else does.&#8221; </p><p class="body">A clinical psychologist who lost his sight due to glaucoma at the age of 19, Mr. Ganatra runs a counselling and corporate training organisation called &#8216;Yellow Brick Road&#8217;.</p><p class="body">The flight was made possible by Templepilots, a paragliding club run by Avi Malik and his wife Anita Deshpande.</p><p class="body">According to Mr. Malik, there are no official records of visually-challenged people having undertaken solo flights. A Master Instructor at the Association of Paragliding Pilots and Instructors, he stated that no other Indian had attempted this before. &#8220;There are probably one or two worldwide who have attempted this successfully,&#8221; he said. A hearing-impaired Belgian performed the same feat under his guidance last year.</p><p class="body">For Mr. Ganatra, however, it wasn&#8217;t about the achievement or about proving a point to anyone. &#8220;I did it because of my love for the sport,&#8221; he said. For Mr. Malik and his wife, taking up his request was an &#8220;instinctive decision.&#8221; &#8220;The heart said yes first, the mind worked on it later,&#8221; Mr. Malik said.</p><p class="body">What was most important was working together and having faith in each other. &#8220;I trusted them with my life. That is the only way I could have done this,&#8221; Mr. Ganatra said. Ms. Deshpande agreed. &#8220;It was about trust, and not about [never] flying anymore.&#8221;</p><p class="body"> The experience helped Mr. Malik stretch his own boundaries as a teacher as he sought to find new ways and means to guide Mr. Ganatra. &#8220;One way was using simulation, and working on other senses: touching, feeling and listening,&#8221; he said. To explain the concepts of aerodynamics, Mr. Malik asked Mr. Ganatra to use his hands to understand how the glider works. </p><p class="body">In a &#8216;tandem&#8217; flight with an instructor, he learnt what the experience could be like.

It&#8217;s been seven years in the making.</p><p class="body">The moment the Railway Ministry shows the green signal to the rolling stock and electrification, the last hurdle to Metro becoming operational will be crossed.</p><p class="body">&#8220;The final safety inspection by the CMRS was completed on April 28. Once the final certificate is received from the Ministry, the line will be open for commercial use within seven days,&#8221; said Sanjay Sethi, Additional Commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). </p><p class="body">Travel time on the 11.4-km stretch between Versova and Ghatkopar is likely to come down by more than an hour.</p><p class="body"> The air-conditioned, four-car Metro is expected to carry 60,000 commuters per hour in either direction. Once the eastern and western suburbs are connected, traffic snarls on this route will likely reduce, say MMRDA officials.</p><p class="body">The contract for constructing the VAG corridor was awarded to the consortium of Reliance Energy Limited, a Reliance ADA Group Company; Veolia Transport, France; and the MMRDA.</p><p class="body">The Metro project has reached this stage after having missed several deadlines. Conceived in 2007, it was to have been completed in five years. With a delay of two years, the project cost has doubled &#8212; from Rs. 2,356 crore in 2007 to Rs. 4,321 crore.</p><p class="body">Two other Metro lines are also under construction. Line 2, a 31.87-km elevated corridor, begins from the northern suburbs at Charkop and stretches up to Mankhurd (via Bandra and Kurla) in the east. Metro Line 3 (Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ) is 32.50 km long and fully underground with 27 stations. In February, the MMRDA, in charge of planning and executing infrastructure projects in the region, also started the first phase of Monorail. The corridor connects the eastern suburbs of Wadala and Chembur.</p><p class="body">Although inaugurated with much pomp, Monorail has turned out to be one of the most underutilised public transport utilities in the city. </p><hr><h1>Despite poverty, Assamese migrants feel safer in U.P. </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 06:23 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> On April 16, Feroz endured a 36-hour train journey from Lucknow to reach his village in Barpeta district in Assam. Eight days later, he went to the Chenga polling booth in his village, Radhakuchi Habi, and cast his vote. He returned to the Uttar Pradesh capital a few days later. The entire trip cost Feroz around Rs.10,000.</p><p class="body">Despite his meagre earnings, Feroz travels from Lucknow to Assam to vote in every election.</p><p class="body">Ali feared, as always, the possibility of attacks by Bodo militants as the train passed Kokrajhar, a two-hour drive from Barpeta. &#8220;The Bodos not only burn our homes, they also attack trains and rob people. They kill us without any hesitation. We breathe a sigh of relief when we reach home,&#8221; says Feroz.</p><p class="body">Amid the unfolding of fresh ethnic violence in Assam, migrants from the State living in Lucknoware anxious about the safety of their relatives back home. Their only source of accurate information is the television.</p><p class="body">&#8220;It&#8217;s only a matter of time before the violence spreads to other districts,&#8221; says Feroz, who is seated in a small thatched hut on the outskirts of Lucknow. He lives with his wife, four sons and a daughter. The violence in Assam, though alarming, is remote. Abject poverty and the terror of floods caused by the Brahmaputra has, over the years, forced thousands of Assamese to migrate to other parts of the country. Around 40,000 Assamese migrants live in the U.P. capital.</p><p class="body">The Assamese started arriving in Lucknow three decades ago. Their migration peaked as the Bodoland movement caught fire, says Roli Misra, an academic with extensive field experience on the migrants&#8217; issues. In Lucknow, most of the migrants live in squalor. The majority of these migrants pick waste for a living. But their deepest hurt comes when they are tagged as &#8220;Bangladeshis&#8221; despite carrying valid identity cards.</p><p class="body">It is the concern that his name might be removed from the voters&#8217; list &#8212; virtually a loss of identity and cause for persecution &#8212; that drives Feroz to vote without fail. &#8220;If I miss the vote at home, I fear they will chop my name off the voter list. Then I will have no home, no identity. Here we are always suspected to be Bangladeshis,&#8221; he says. Their physical and linguistic resemblance to Bangladeshis makes these migrants easy targets of police harassment. &#8220;The society still views us with suspicion. We fear that if we ever get reprimanded, our identities will be used to persecute us,&#8221; says Feroz&#8217;s son Ali (name changed), who is struggling with his studies in a college in Lucknow.</p><p class="body">18-year-old Ali, who follows news keenly, views the violence back home with concern. &#8220;How do the Bodos get weapons unless the Tarun Gogoi government is helping them? They aren&#8217;t economically better off than us. So who is helping them? Why do only our people die,&#8221; he asks. Ali requests this reporter to conceal his identity, lest his friends in college find out about his living conditions. &#8220;I tell my friends that I live in a rented apartment. If they find out I live in this condition, I will be mocked,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="body">Despite difficulties in paying colleges fees, he hopes to find a decent job some day. But few migrants can afford private education.</p><p class="body">Administrative apathy and strict regulations make it difficult for migrants to get admission in public schools. The transfer of their voter cards to Lucknow is also hindered by administrative conditions. &#8220;They aren&#8217;t able to get ration cards in Lucknow as the administration demands that they must first cancel their original Assam-based ration cards,&#8221; says Sandeep Pandey, Magsaysay Award&#8211;winning social activist. Cancelling their ration cards back home, however, would effectively extirpate their identity.</p><p class="body">By terming these migrants as &#8220;Bangladeshis&#8221;, the administration abdicates all responsibility, says Mr. Pandey. In 2009, he undertook a drive to convince the administration that the people it was uprooting from slums in Lucknow were in fact Assamese.</p><p class="body">While things have since improved, the stigma remains in their minds, says Mr. Pandey. Despite that, Zain (25), a waste-picker, is thankful that in Lucknow they have a stable means of living and are secure. </p><hr><h1>Dying strains of a bygone era </h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 06:19 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> Over time, the &#8216;current potti&#8217; has replaced this ancient music box used by Koothu troupes.

Another person, Chokkalingam of Ranipet, is the son of Narasimha Reddiar, a very senior person who taught the trade to many,&#8221; he said.<b>Harmonium legend</b>Nellalam Su. Krishnan (75), an actor and harmonium player, also confirmed the legendary status of harmoniums made by Narasimha Reddiar, who does not make them anymore. &#8220;He must be older than I am. Pedal harmoniums are costly since very few are made. Both the lower and higher octaves will be heard in these harmoniums. The sound will also be quite loud as is required for koothu performances,&#8221; he explained.</p><p class="body">The famous Kannan Harmonium Works in Chennai too has stopped manufacturing pedal harmoniums. &#8220;People prefer keyboards these days as they are cheaper than new pedal harmoniums.

They torched houses, fired indiscriminately at people and hacked those had fallen to bullets. Some people jumped into the river to save their lives. But the militants fired at them also. I just managed to flee the scene and snatched our old trunk and jumped into the Beki river.

Moidul was not able to trace his mother Maibul Nessa and five-year-old sister Jaigan Nessa till Saturday afternoon while he fled into a nearby jungle and stayed there until he was rescued by villagers. The villagers said more than 20 persons were still missing.</p><p class="body">Kasem Ali, 30, who was home, first mistook the firing for gunshots fired by forest guards at timber smugglers. &#8220;Some of us ran towards to the forest camp.

Nagar bus terminus and stormwater drains in added areas. </p><p class="body"> &#8220;We have sought a sum of Rs. 50 crore from the World Bank for various aspects of the T. Nagar makeover. The projects likely to get funding from the World Bank will be identified next week,&#8221; said an official of Chennai Corporation. </p><p class="body"> The skywalk connecting Mambalam railway station and T.

Sufficient resources in the Veeranam tank in Cuddalore district and Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh will help the city sustain piped supply on alternate days. </p><p class="body">With the groundwater level falling to a depth of under 5 metres in the city following lack of rains, more people have come to depend on Metrowater supply. The news that adequate resources exist in the two reservoirs will bring some relief to residents. &#8220;We will be able to manage the water supply till August with the existing resources and Krishna water,&#8221; said an official of the Water Resources Department (WRD). </p><p class="body">The water levels at the city reservoirs, which were in a precarious state for several months, are rising due to a steady inflow of Krishna water. Poondi reservoir, the prime storage point, is receiving nearly 370 cubic feet per second of water (cusecs). &#8220;We are expecting an increase to 500 cusecs from next week. It will also help us to step up storage in the water body,&#8221; said the official.</p><p class="body">Chennai has received about 2,800 million cubic feet (mcft) of Krishna water since January, which translates to three months of water supply. </p><p class="body">On the other end, Veeranam tank is also brimming with inflow from the Mettur dam. A WRD official said that instead of filling it to its capacity, the water level is being maintained at 1,067 mcft to minimise loss by evaporation. A 230-km-long- pipeline from the tank transports about 180 million litres of water a day (mld) to Chennai. </p><p class="body">The current storage levels of the four city reservoirs &#8212; Red Hills, Poondi, Chembarambakkam and Cholavaram &#8212; almost matches last year&#8217;s levels of 3,053 mcft, said an official. However, officials are concerned about the increasing water loss due to evaporation. Even the minimal water available at Cholavaram reservoir is being pumped out to Red Hills as it otherwise gets wasted in summer. </p><p class="body">Chennai Metrowater plans to continue to provide 610 mld on alternate days till the storage in reservoirs reaches a comfortable position of 7,000 mcft. </p><hr><h1>Minor raped at gunpoint in U.P. village</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 06:23 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> A 14-year-old girl was allegedly raped at gunpoint by five youths in Nanu village in Uttar Pradesh&#8217;s Sardhana area on Thursday.

Pottery and iron fragments of that period are still seen scattered in the opened cists. </p><p class="body"/><p class="body"> The ASI has dashed off letters to the Department of Mines and Geology and the Department of Kannada and Culture to prohibit quarrying and protect the few burial chambers that remain. It has also sent its field officers to assess the damage and take steps to prevent further ruin. </p><p class="body"/><p class="body"> &#8220;The destruction of the burial site has been taking place systematically over the years, and now almost all the 50 graves have been vandalised,&#8221; said a village resident of Chapparkallu.

Meanwhile, an ASI source said: &#8220;Some of the burial chambers were vandalised even before it came under ASI protection. The geomorphology of the site, that had remained intact for centuries, started changing suddenly due to urbanisation.

In a wide-ranging interview with Vinay Kumar, he said the BJP would instil a sense of confidence and affection in minorities, and asserted that its prime ministerial nominee, Narendra Modi, was secular. He said the BJP, if it came to power, would not be revengeful. Excerpts:</i></p><p class="body"><b>The Hindu: You have campaigned extensively in all States. What is your assessment of the BJP&#8217;s chances after seven phases of polling?</b></p><p class="body"><b>Rajnath Singh:</b> I am confident that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will get 300 seats in this election. We are in a much better position than ever before.</p><p class="body"><b>How would you rate the party&#8217;s chances in the southern States?</b></p><p class="body">We are in a much better position. We will do well in Karnataka and win 15 to 18 seats. In Tamil Nadu, the BJP-led alliance is expected to come up with good results and bag a good number of seats, but I shall not get into the numbers game. We will open our account in Kerala. In Andhra Pradesh, we have an alliance with the Telugu Desam Party, and it is but natural that our numbers will go up. We feel that the Congress has not done justice to Seemandhra. Our party supported carving out a new State of Telangana, but we also wanted that justice should be done to both the States &#8212; Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.</p><p class="body"><b>If a BJP-led government comes to power after the elections, will you look into this issue?</b></p><p class="body">We have always said that justice should be done to both the States, and this has been our demand. Most certainly, we will ensure that this happens. The Congress should have done it much earlier. After all, it had been on the cards for the past 10 years, but they waited till the election and took this step in haste.</p><p class="body"><b>How will the BJP do in Uttar Pradesh?</b></p><p class="body">Our target is 60 and beyond. I am confident.</p><p class="body"><b>There have been reports that you would not like to be part of the government if the BJP comes of power. What are your views on this?</b></p><p class="body">Much has been made about this. I am already president of the party, and my two-year term is still remaining. This responsibility is already there, and I will fulfil it.</p><p class="body"><b>Are you open about post-election alliances? What will your stand be on old friends such as the Trinamool Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party?</b></p><p class="body">I feel there will not be any need for this. The BJP-led NDA combine will get a clear majority. If someone wants to give support in the national interest, we will welcome such support. There is nothing specific on the table right now.</p><p class="body"><b>The BJP has often charged the Congress with having a dual-power centre?</b></p><p class="body">We have not charged, [Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s former media adviser] Sanjaya Baru has charged. We expected the Congress leadership to respond [to the charge]; it has not. This means that what Sanjaya Baru has said in his book The Accidental Prime Minister is correct. Only Dr. Manmohan Singh&#8217;s daughter has reacted, the Congress leadership has not. And what Baru has written, if it is true, then the Congress leadership has caused immense damage and hurt to the nation. Not only the Prime Minister&#8217;s, its [PMO&#8217;s] dignity as a high institution has also been lowered. Remote control of the government, as pointed out by Baru, has hurt the nation to a great extent. That is why it has been a non-functional government; that is why all this talk about policy paralysis. Even now, I would like the Congress leadership to react to the contents of Baru&#8217;s book. After all, the nation wants to know all the facts.</p><p class="body"><b>BJP patriarch L.K. Advani has described Manmohan Singh as the &#8220;weakest PM.&#8221; What is your view?</b></p><p class="body">The government was indeed weak and if what Baru says in his book is correct, then the government was weakened by 10 Janpath [official residence of Congress president Sonia Gandhi]. Advaniji made the &#8220;weakest PM&#8221; remark some years ago, but I want the Congress&#8217;s clarification on, and reaction to, the contents of Baru&#8217;s book.</p><p class="body"><b>But the BJP&#8217;s ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, also has &#8220;remote control&#8221; over the party?</b></p><p class="body">The nation has only one remote control and it is in 10 Janpath; Baru has said it in his book, I am not saying it. The country cannot have many remote controls. Where does the RSS figure? When we talk about our relationship with the RSS, we are all RSS volunteers.</p><p class="body"><b>Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and other eminent secular liberals have expressed their apprehension about Mr. Modi, saying minorities do not feel secure about his coming to power and they have not been given enough reassurance.</b></p><p class="body">The Congress and the so-called pseudo-secular parties have created a sense of fear in the minds of minorities in order to get their votes. But we will replace this sense of fear with a sense of confidence and we will create a sense of affection among them. All citizens are equal, this is our ideology and Modiji has been reiterating this.</p><p class="body"><b>The blot of the 2002 Gujarat riots has not been cleared convincingly.</b></p><p class="body">The probe has been done under the Supreme Court&#8217;s supervision, if there is an international agency like this it can also look into it. But is there a bigger agency than the country&#8217;s Supreme Court? Mr. Modi has got a clean chit in every way. I fail to understand why there is a question mark over his intention and his integrity. I know that Narendra Modi is by nature secular. </p><p class="body"><b>But he is dubbed a polarising figure?</b></p><p class="body">Actually, those who want to polarise politics, they level such allegations. They want to divert the attention of the common masses from issues of good governance, development. That&#8217;s why our political opponents indulge in this discussion.</p><p class="body"><b>The Congress has said it will appoint a judge to investigate Snoopgate. It also wants to go ahead with some key appointments.</b></p><p class="body">I ask them: Is it a healthy tradition? Already a commission of inquiry is working, and you are talking of appointing another commission. This approach of the Congress-led government is unhealthy and, I will say, it is unethical as well.

While a residential layout occupies the megalithic site in Chikkajala, a road has been laid over the site at Kannur.

Protection of megalithic sites is a matter of concern as destruction will erase a piece of history, said Smriti Haricharan, a post doctoral associate at the National Institute of Advanced Studies. &#8220;Most of these sites are not well documented and once the burial sites are opened, information is lost forever. Though protection of these sites is difficult, it is also important to keep them intact.&#8221; </p><p class="body"/><p class="body"> Ms. Smriti said thousands of megalithic sites have been documented in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra. </p><hr><h1>Road humps on highway pose danger to motorists</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 18:08 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">Road humps, which surface every few kilometres on the Bangalore-Mysore highway, have emerged as a major nuisance to motorists. Laid unscientifically, many of these road humps have been identified as the cause for mishaps, particularly at night. </p><p class="body"> S. Prasad, a regular driver on the 140-km long highway, said the road humps, some which are laid almost overnight, often take him by surprise. Neither are they painted nor do they have reflectors or signboards to draw the driver&#8217;s attention. </p><p class="body"> Azeem Farhan, whose car was hit by a trailing car recently when he applied brakes after spotting a road hump at the last moment, called driving by night on the highway a nightmarish experience. Many regular drivers on the highway have cited instances of motorists losing control when they drive over speed breakers, sometimes causing injuries to the occupants. </p><p class="body">Despite repeated assurances from the State government to remove unscientific road humps, most of which have been laid at the behest of residents of villages along the highway, little progress has been made.</p><p class="body">Minister for Public Works H.C. Mahadevappa, who frequently travels by the highway, admitted that many of the estimated 100 road humps on the road had been laid unscientifically and did not conform to the specifications of the Indian Road Congress.</p><p class="body">With the Union Transport Ministry deciding to upgrade the four-lane road to a six-lane national highway soon, Mr. Mahadevappa said the unscientific road humps will be removed when the is taken up. &#8220;We will ensure that speed breakers are put only where necessary and they strictly conform to the safety standards, which includes painting and illuminating by reflectors.&#8221; Motorists, therefore, will have to wait till the government goes ahead with the upgradation of the highway. There is no confirmation on when the work will commence. </p><p class="body"/><p class="body"/><hr><h1>Chennai train blast: Lack of CCTV surveillance hinders probe</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 00:49 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body"> The Crime Branch &#8211; Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) team of the Tamil Nadu police, which is in the city in connection with the blasts on the Bangalore-Guwahati Express, hit a road block as they found no leads from the CCTV footage at City Railway station. </p><p class="body"/><p class="body"> <b>Visited stations</b> </p><p class="body"/><p class="body"> On Saturday, the team visited Cantonment Railway Station, Bangalore East Railway Station and K R Puram Railway station where the train had halted. </p><p class="body"/><p class="body"> However, the team was surprised to find that CCTV cameras are not installed at any of these stations. </p><p class="body"/><p class="body"> <b>Team miffed</b> </p><p class="body"/><p class="body"> Sources say that the team was miffed at the lack of CCTV surveillance at these railway stations, as they felt that the culprits might have exploited this loophole.

After Amir Mir, brother of journalist and anchorperson Hamid Mir who was shot in Karachi on April 19, blamed the ISI for the murderous attempt, the empire has struck back in a big way. </p><p class="body">On the same day while ISI director general Zaheer-ul-Islam&#8217;s photograph was on air for several hours, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued a statement condemning the incident and called for an independent inquiry. </p><p class="body">Raising allegations against the ISI or the head of ISI without any basis is highly regrettable and misleading, the ISPR spokesperson said.</p><p class="body">A week after the attack on Hamid Mir, posters with the DG ISI&#8217;s photo and slogans saying &#8216;Pakistan loves the Army&#8217; appeared in the capital.</p><p class="body">Earlier this week there were huge protests in major cities which sought to express solidarity with the ISI and criticised Geo TV.</p><p class="body">On Saturday the Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD), among the groups which put up the posters supporting the Pakistan army, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and other political parties organised a protest ironically on World Press Freedom Day. Amir Mughal, of the PTI said the media cannot attack Pakistan&#8217;s biggest institution.</p><p class="body">Mariana Babar, diplomatic correspondent for <i>The News</i> told <i>The Hindu</i> on the phone that the ISI taking on the media was not something new.</p><p class="body">When she started her career under the martial law regime of Zia-ul-Haq, things were more or less the same. The situation appears as if the country has gone back to the 1980s, she pointed out and nothing seems to have changed over the years. </p><p class="body">However, she said the media, specially the electronic media should show greater responsibility while reporting news.</p><p class="body">While everyone thought that other institutions in Pakistan had become strong like the media, judiciary, and civil society, Ms. Babar said, as soon as they stepped on the toes of the army, it hit back to show that it is still a sacred institution. </p><p class="body">The army remains powerful and possessive about its space, she said. </p><p class="body">Already <i>The News</i> and the <i>Jang</i> were being stopped in parts of the garrison city of Rawalpindi and other areas.</p><p class="body">On the day after the attack on Hamid Mir, except for <i>The News</i> most other English newspapers played down the incident and chose to highlight the ISPR statement.

Â The printing of indecipherable words by <i>Daily Mirror</i>, an English newspaper here, seemed to be aimed at sparking questions about the state of media freedom in the country, and what it spawns &#8212; self-censorship.<b>Freedom of press</b>The sole legible sentence on the front page read: &#8220;Only true freedom of the press can turn things the right way around. Celebrating World Press Freedom Day 2014!&#8221; Â </p><p class="body">The message rang a bell as Sri Lanka, for long, has been grappling with the issue of media freedom. There have been many instances of media persons being attacked, and even murdered. </p><p class="body">The country has lost some of its senior journalists, including Lasantha Wickrematunge, editor of theÂ <i>SundayÂ Leader</i>. Â </p><p class="body">&#8220;The fact that none of the perpetrators has been brought to justice is rather worrying,&#8221; V. Thanapalabalasingham, Editor of <i>Thinakural</i>, a Tamil daily. Such a situation only breeds more fear and consequently, self-censorship, said media professionals. The culture of self-censorship, in turn, negatively impacted the quality of journalism, they observed.</p><p class="body">&#8220;Gains in professional standards could be undermined by a culture of self-censorship which could be due to a multitude of reasons, &#8221; said Amal Jayasinghe, bureau chief of Agence France-Presse (AFP), adding that risk aversion and a lack of resources threatened to bring down the credibility of Sri Lanka&#8217;s press.</p><p class="body">Observing that there was a threat to the freedom of expression, Saman Wagaarachchi, editor of Sinhala paper <i>Lakbima</i> said: &#8220;Today, most media organisations are wary of being critical of the government and therefore, self-censorship is a major issue.&#8221; </p><p class="body">Over the last few years, media freedom in Sri Lanka has drawn increased international attention.

With over 265 polling booths spread across both the rural and urban mandals, it has as much diversity in population as would the country. </p><p class="body">The diversity works both ways. On the one hand, candidates and parties with a national presence are likely to draw the attention of outstation and educated voters and, on the other, voters from the region are likely to be carried away by local issues and regional parties are able to connect well with them. </p><p class="body">National and long-term perspectives, which are an inherent part of the trade union discourse, have not converted into votes for any party. The substantial voter base among the employed and members of the trade union has encouraged both the Left parties &#8212; the CPI and CPI(M) &#8212; to enter the fray. </p><p class="body">The CPI is represented by former corporator A.J. Stalin and the CPI (M) has fielded its State Executive member and trade union leader Ch. Narsinga Rao. </p><p class="body">However, the parties are unable to convert the strong trade union following into votes, a trade union leader has admitted.</p><p class="body">Mr. Narsinga Rao is a known name among the workers in Gajuwaka as he has led a number of agitations under the umbrella of the CITU demanding protection of Public Sector Unit assets and rights of workers. He has also been able to wrangle out a decent living wage for the contract workers. </p><p class="body">Mr. Stalin has a good track record as a councillor, corporator, and as director of Visakhapatnam Urban Cooperative Bank Ltd.

His father&#8217;s track record as a trade union leader is likely to get him substantial votes from employees, who comprise over 40 per cent of the population. A bonus could be the tipping of substantial traditional BJP votes, apart from members of trade unions that are favourably inclined towards the BJP. </p><p class="body">Chintalpudi Venkataramaiah, who won in 2009 on the Praja Rajyam ticket and subsequently went into the Congress, switched sides along with Ganta Srinivas Rao and eventually is out of contest this time.</p><hr><h1>Tunes from Kolkata</h1><p><h4> Updated: May 4, 2014 15:56 IST &#013; </h4><p><p class="body">Madhubanti Bagchi&#8217;s earthy, full-throated rendition of a popular Baul (Bengali) &#8216;Nodi Bhora Dheu&#8230;&#8217; (the river is full of tides...) for <i>Masala Republic</i>, captures the ebb and flow of life where man is hapless in this journey. </p><p class="body">A Bengali rock band doing the title song for a Malayalam film is fitting, ironically. Kerala is after all home to a considerable population of Bengali migrants. Kolkata-based band Mrittika was, however, clueless about this fact when they were asked to do the film&#8217;s title track. </p><p class="body">The only exposure the band had had to Malayalam and Kerala until then was a television show on Kappa TV. Playing mostly in Bengal, the suggestion that they could play for a TV show in Kerala was a surprise. &#8220;Someone from Kerala who was familiar with our music told us about the show. We got in touch with the channel and we were on,&#8221; says Madhubanti, one of the band&#8217;s vocalists, over phone from Kolkata.</p><p class="body">The trip to Kerala, and the recording, was an adventure. She says they just wanted to &#8216;see&#8217; how people took to their brand of music. </p><p class="body">The seven-member fusion band comprises, besides Madhubanti, Suchal Chakraborthy (vocals), Diptangshu Chakraborthy (guitar), Zafar Ansari (keyboards), Nilanjan Ghosh (drums), Sudipto Sarkar (bass) Shouvik Mukherjee (zitar) and Suomojyoti Ghosh (flute). </p><p class="body">It counts among its influences musicians as diverse as Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Pandit Ravi Shankar, A.R. Rahman, Trilok Gurtu, Jimi Hendrix, John Coltrane and Miles Davis. &#8216;Nodi Bhora Dheu&#8230;&#8217; is a popular Baul song. </p><p class="body">The band, which does covers and originals, presented a combination of Bangla and Hindi numbers and was surprised by the response. That show led them to the film. </p><p class="body">One of the editors of the film put them in touch with the director, G.S. Vishakh. Philosophy in a satire might appear misplaced, but the director disagrees, &#8220;The film is about a journey, and the song is the score for the journey &#8211; literally and metaphorically.&#8221; </p><p class="body">Why a Bengali band for a Malayalam film was the question that even Mrittika wondered about. For authenticity&#8217;s sake, says the director. &#8220;We were told about the film&#8217;s Bengali context and then everything fell into place,&#8221; she says. </p><p class="body">A rough video of the filming also helped. The choice of song fell on the band. The philosophy-laden Baul song combined with one of the band&#8217;s Sufi original, was zeroed in on and approved. </p><hr>
